ABSTRACT: The aim of this article is to review electronic resources in Latin, analyzing
their didactic potential to help Classical teachers to effectively organize the educational
process, diversifying the set of tools, and enhancing their work. Today, most of the useful
links are accumulated on domestic professional sites devoted to the study of Latin. Many
foreign scientists and teachers simply do not know about their existence. From time to
time, attempts are made to summarize information and provide content for studying
Classic languages in scientific publications, but such information quickly becomes
outdated and needs to be regularly updated. This article provides an overview of the
current most popular resources on Latin: digital libraries and databases, online courses,
electronic textbooks, dictionary, translators etc.; describing the current state of the
development of e-learning tools and websites for the study of Latin in Ukraine.
KEYWORDS: electronic educational resources; online resources; language learning; Latin

RESUMO: O objetivo do artigo é revisar recursos eletrônicos em Latim, analisando seu
potencial didático para ajudar os professores clássicos a organizar efetivamente o
processo educacional, diversificando o conjunto de ferramentas e aprimorando o seu
trabalho. Hoje, a maioria dos links úteis é acumulada em vários sites domésticos
dedicados ao estudo do Latim. Muitos cientistas e professores estrangeiros simplesmente
não sabem sobre sua existência. De tempos em tempos, são feitas tentativas de resumir
informações e fornecer conteúdo para o estudo de línguas clássicas em publicações
científicas, mas essas informações rapidamente ficam desatualizadas e precisam ser
atualizadas regularmente. Este artigo fornece uma visão geral dos recursos mais
populares da atualidade em Latim: bibliotecas digitais e bancos de dados, cursos online,
livros eletrônicos, dicionário, tradutores etc.; descreve o estado atual de desenvolvimento
das ferramentas de e-learning e sites para o estudo do Latim na Ucrânia.
PALAVRAS-CHAVE: recursos educacionais eletrônicos; recursos online; aprendizagem
de línguas; língua latina.
1 Introduction
In 2006, with the support of the European Commission, the CIRCE (Classics and
ICT Resource Course for Europe) project was launched; it combines the efforts of
European scholars and teachers to develop effective methods for using ICTs in Classic
languages teaching. As the authors of the project emphasize, traditional methods of
teaching Latin and Greek should be revised in the 21st century. The goal of the project is

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.12.3.93-108

to support and provide Classical teachers with effective methods for using computer
technology in the learning process. Within the framework of the project, the manual for
teachers containing generalization and systematization of best practices in this field,
theoretical and practical advice on the use of existing and the creation of new electronic
resources for the study of Latin, as well as the results of research in this area have been
published in six languages (MORGAN, 2006).
The website CIRCE (http://www.circe.be/) offers a list of web resources for teaching
and learning Latin and Greek such as The Classical Art Research Centre database of
University of Oxford, Cambridge museum of Classical archaeology database, Packard
Humanities Institute, Greek Inscriptions, Fitzwilliam Museum Online Collections Database,
Ashmolean Museum Online Collections Database, British Museum Online Collections
Database Chiron (CC images of the classical world), The Digital Classicist (advanced
digital methods applied to the study of the ancient world), Perseus Latin word study tool,
The Latin Quarter (allow hearing Latin read aloud, access online supports for The
Complete Latin Course, watch films with Latin spoken), Classics stuff (line-by-line
vocabulary lists for classical texts), Pelagios Digital Map of the Roman Empire (interactive
map of the ancient world) etc.
However, in the post-Soviet countries (including Ukraine) the development of
electronic content for learning Latin is gaining momentum, but already has a certain
experience, not covered in this project as well as the experience of American, Asian,
Australian teachers. Most of the useful links are accumulated on several domestic sites
devoted to the study of Latin. Many foreign scientists and teachers simply do not know
about their existence. From time to time, attempts are made to summarize information and
provide content for studying classical languages in scientific publications (BALALAIEVA,
2014; HARDWICK, 2000; HINKE, 2009; HUNT, 2018; LISTER; SMITH, 2001; LISTER,
2007; MAHONEY, 2001; PANTELIA, 1995; REINHARD, 2012), but such information
quickly becomes outdated and needs to be regularly updated. There is a shortage of
scientific works of a general character, in which information on this issue is systematized.
The aim of this article is to review electronic resources in Latin, analyzing their
didactic potential to help Classical teachers to effectively organize the educational
process, diversifying the set of tools, and enhancing their work.
Since there are no unified criteria for evaluating resources for teaching and learning
Latin, in selecting resources we have been guided by criteria, which were developed
based on CARS checklist for evaluating Internet research sources (HARRIS, 1997),
Adaptable usability heuristic checklist for online courses (DRINGUS; COHEN, 2005), and
Criteria for selection of educational materials used in foreign language teaching
(KORSAKOVA, 2014).
According to the aim of this article, 10 criteria were established, as follows:
credibility, accuracy, reasonableness, support, interactivity, aesthetics, accessibility,
communicative value, pragmatic value, and cognitive value. A pilot survey was conducted
in a representative group (n=9). 9 Classical teachers of the National University of Life and
Environmental Sciences of Ukraine were offered to rate 60 online resources on these
criteria on a five-point scale: 1 – very low, 2 – low, 3 – medium, 4 – high, 5 – very high. The
results of the survey are given in Appendix 1.

2 E-libraries and databases
Such resources as e-libraries and databases were highly rated by criteria of
credibility and accuracy. Most of them are well-designed and well-supported. But because
of their specific nature, they have low interactivity, communicative and pragmatic value,
and often are not accessible for a wide range of users.
One of the best e-libraries is Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University
(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/), which has the largest database of Latin and Greek
stuff, consisting of texts (original language, translations) and images. The digital collection
contains about 4 million Latin materials, over 64 thousand images and presentations, but
the most important characteristics of the library are the rational structuring of materials and
database architecture.
The huge resources of the original antique and medieval texts are offered by TLG –
Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: Greek Texts (http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/), PHI5 – Packard
Humanities Institute: Latin Texts and Bible Versions (https://latin.packhum.org/), BTL –
Bibliotheca Teubneriana Latina and TLL – Thesaurus Linguae Latinae
(https://www.degruyter.com/view/db/btltll).
Brepolis, or Brepols' Online Databases (http://www.brepolis.net/) consist of 4 parts:
Source Collection (Brepolis Latin: Library of Latin Texts, Archive of Celtic-Latin Literature,
Aristoteles Latinus Database, Patrologia Orientalis, Database of Latin Dictionaries,
Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources), Stand-alone Database (Vetus Latina
Database), Bibliographies and Encyclopaedias.
A part of the Forum Romanum (D. Camden, Harvard) – Corpus Scriptorum
Latinorum (http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/) – contains a digital library from the
earliest epigraphic writings to the Neo-Latinists works of the 18th century, which is
distinguished not only by the large volume of Latin sources but also by a convenient
search engine (by author, title, year, genre).
The
project
Libellus,
University
of
Washington
(http://www.hhhh.org/perseant/libellus/) provides a library of classical Latin and Greek texts
with minimal redistribution restrictions.
Bibliotheca Latina IntraText, Èulogos SpA (http://www.intratext.com/LATINA/) is a
full-text digital library offering books and corpora as lexical hypertexts on Creative
Commons License, under headings Latinitas Romana (antiqua, classica, postclassica),
Latinitas Mediaevalis and Latinitas Nova.
An
analytic
bibliography
of
online
Neo-Latin
texts
(http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/bibliography/index.htm) contains 63,210 entries on
Latin texts written during the Renaissance and later that are freely available on the Web.
The platform Textkit (https://www.textkit.com/) provides free of charge downloads of
Greek and Latin grammars, readers, lexicons and dictionaries, offers a large library of over
180 of the best Greek and Latin textbooks, for instance, Latin for Beginners (D’Oogle’s),
Beginner’s Latin Book (Collar and Daniell), A Latin Grammar (Charles E. Bennett), New
Latin Grammar (Allen & Greenough), etc.

3 Online courses, software, e-textbooks, tutorials
Users are also offered several courses for learning Latin online and offline. One of
the most famous Latin courses for beginners is the Cambridge Latin Course, which has
proved effective in teaching practice for over 50 years. Besides the traditional printed
edition, this course is now available online (https://www.cambridgescp.com/) and on DVD.
Under a project approved by the British government, Cambridge Latin Course E-Learning
Resources, which contains selected texts, video, and audio materials, was created to raise
the standards of learning Latin and provide greater access to this subject.
This course is highly evaluated in all 10 criteria and holds a leading position in
rating, as well as another popular university course – Oxford Latin Course: Online
(http://www.umsl.edu/~phillipsm/oldrills/index.html).
One more authoritative textbook for beginners with a good track record and more
than 60 years of practice of using in American schools is the Wheelock's Latin, which
continues
to
exist
on
the
Official
Wheelock's
Latin
Series
Website
(http://wheelockslatin.com/). The site provides all materials based on this manual: audio
files, workbooks, flashcards, drill-and-practice programs Latin Vocab Drill 4.0 and Latin
Flash Drill 4.0, etc.
The Rosetta Stone Latin course (https://www.rosettastone.com/learn-latin/) is a
multimedia program for learning Latin from a zero level. The training uses a flash
technique with a combination of text, image, and sound so that the user intuitively
memorizes the words from which phrases and sentences are built in a systematic
progression. Such kinds of speech activity, like listening, reading, speaking are used in the
lessons. The technology developed by the company is called Dynamic Immersion, which
involves learning the language through multiple repetitions and the formation of
associative series on several topics. This technique teaches to perceive and automatically
reproduce the most common speech constructs.
The multimedia product Lingva Latina per se illvstrata by Hans H. Ørberg
(https://lingualatina.dk/wp/) is designed for learning Latin via the natural or direct method,
that encourages students to learn Latin without resorting to translation. It consists of two
parts: Familia Romana (main course) and Roma Aeterna (additional course) and contains
DjVu textbooks, their parts in the author’s reading in mp3 format, interactive grammar
exercises, additional texts collection, Latin-English dictionary.
An
interactive
Latin
course
for
beginners
Latinum
Electronicum
(https://www.degruyter.com/view/db/latinummi) was developed within the framework of the
Swiss Virtual Campus project, which aims to develop modules that incorporate distance
learning courses through the active use of information technology in the higher education
system. The course is presented in three languages – German, French, Italian.
The Latein Online (https://www.scioviam.de/) contains an electronic Latin course,
developed within the framework of the Studierplatz Sprachen project. The general selfstudy course consists of three consecutive modules with control tasks and texts. The
modules correspond to the structure of the Latin course in many German universities, so
the transition from an online course to university and the other way around is possible.
The website
Latin Teaching Materials at Saint Louis University

operating for 12 years. Besides SLU Classical Program Information it contains set of Latin
e-books for Kindle and other devices, Grammar and Vocabulary Helps, which presents the
essentials of beginning and intermediate Latin morphology, Latin Praxis – series of
exercises and Explanation Pages, Verbal Brilliance in Latin – set of handouts in pdf format,
Rudimenta in Motu (Flash movies), Timelines for Roman History, Reading Acceleration
Machine – a tachistoscope that supports efficient and rhythmic reading, rehearsal of textcomprehension, and acceleration in reading speed.
The platform Latinitium (https://www.latinitium.com/) is for anyone wanting to learn
to read and speak Latin, contains audio/video podcasts in Latin, articles on learning Latin,
several resources, from texts to online dictionaries.
The Carmenta Online Latin (http://www.carmentalatin.com/) offers Latin Course,
curricula for the SAT® Latin Subject Test or AP® Latin Exam, or individual curriculum
through one-on-one skype instruction with teachers.
Transparent Language (https://www.transparent.com/) proposes a two-level Latin
course, each level has 8 units, including 3-5 vocabulary lessons (accompanied by images
and sounds) and 1 grammar lesson (accompanied by additional instructions and drills on
topics).
A
well-organized
and
comprehensive
tutorial
Latin
Online
https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/latol is proposed by The Linguistics Research Center at the
University of Texas at Austin.
The Power-Glide Latin Ultimate (http://www.lexiconer.com/power-glide/power-glidelatin-ultimate-course.html) proposes 2-year courses for learners 7th-12th grade and adult.
Activities in the course are diverse enough to accommodate many learning styles using
music, stories, memory aids, diglot weaves, kinesthetic, visual, audio activities, and more.
Medieval Latin by UK National Archives (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/) is
a two-stage beginners’ guide to medieval Latin.
Among the well-known courses we should also point out: Ecce Romani
(https://people.umass.edu/~glawall/ecceroma.html), Evan der Millner's Latin Language
Course
(https://sites.google.com/site/janualinguae/),
Linney's
Latin
Class
(http://www.linneyslatinclass.com/), Mundus Latinus (http://info.munduslatinus.de/), Schola
Latina Europaea & Úniversalis (http://avitus.alcuinus.net/schola_latina/), KET's Distance
Learning Latin Program, Kentucky Educational Television (https://www.ket.org/making-adifference/distance-learning), Latin pour debutant (https://www.prima-elementa.fr/Latin01.html).
In learning Latin, algorithmic learning activities, such as developing abilities and
skills on the definition of the type of syntactic construction, the translation of the word/term
is very important. Some students need more training, repetitions and checking for the
correct execution of these actions than a teacher can provide in the classroom face-to-face
studies, while interactive guides and manuals are able to provide such an opportunity.
There are numerous resources available on the Internet which include tests on and
exercises of varying difficulty levels to test grammar and translation skills, for example,

The website Navigium (https://www.navigium.de/) contains educational software,
grammar exercises, vocabulary, and the lexical simulator Latein-Vokabeltrainer – an
optimal tool for effectively memorizing Latin vocabulary, while Haudenverres
(http://www.haudenverres.de/) teaches the very mechanism for translating Latin texts.
Far fewer authoritative sites for learning Latin are developed and function on the
territory of the former USSR. One of them is the site of the Department of Classical
Philology of the Belarusian State University Philologia classica (http://graecolatini.bsu.by/)
created 15 years ago. For studying Latin, the site offers 12 Belarusian textbooks and
manuals for students of philological, historical, philosophical, and law specialties, a training
complex for part-time students of philological and historical studies.
There is a new, original Latin-Russian dictionary, which is quite different from other
such editions and is the first lexicographic research showing the dynamics of the
development of Latin vocabulary (this version is also used by ABBYY Lingvo 12 ML) on
the site. The chronological framework of the material is quite large: from classical Latin to
modern terminology.
Also, the resource offers interesting texts and dialogues in Latin, a computer
program-converter, which allows you to transfer the dates into the Gregorian and Julian
calendars, the program Titlo, which translates numbers from a modern record into Roman
numerals. The site also provides several collections of Latin proverbs and the student
anthem Gaudeamus.
For 15 years now, another popular site Lingua Latina Aeterna
(http://linguaeterna.com/la/) has existed. It’s positioned as a living Latin page and unites
the enthusiasts of the revival of this ancient language. The authors of the project compile
their own Latin-Russian dictionary, plan a fundamental lexicographic work, which should
include the vocabulary not only of the classical period but also the medieval one as well as
neologisms reflecting the concepts of modern reality, create a Latin-Russian phrasebook.
The site contains educational materials: the textbook Латинский язык без труда, an
adapted Russian version of the textbook Lingua Latina sine Molestia with audio files,
classical editions on Latin grammar and syntax, electronic dictionaries: Lexicon Mediae
Latinatis, Latin-Russian dictionary (based on the Dvoretsky’s dictionary), The Great LatinRussian dictionary (the author is the founder of the site M. Polashev). Also, issues of
teaching Latin, nuances of the Latin translation, new audio and video materials are
regularly discussed on the site’s forum. The work of the site is supported in four language
versions: Latin, English, Russian and Ukrainian.
The webpage Latinum.ru: Все о латинском языке (http://latinum.ru/) hosts over 40
Russian-language textbooks, manuals and dictionaries on Latin for different specialties
(lawyers, medics, biologists, philologists, teachers), the audiobook Catchphrases in Latin

and Russian, online translators.
Some of the most noteworthy of Russian-language resources are: Латинск.ру –
территория
латыни
(http://latinsk.ru/),
На
латыни
про
латынь
(http://www.latinpro.info/index.php), Латинский язык (https://www.lingualatina.ru/).
The Russian-language multimedia course Быстрый вход в латынь (Quick entry
into Latin, I. Poloneichik) is designed for the widest possible audience and offers the
minimum set of information about the language needed for mastering the skills of correct
pronunciation and reading: dictionaries “mini-lex” (500 units) and “mini-phrase” (100 units)
in text and audio versions, “mini-gramms” – mini-grammar with basic rules, texts,
exercises, tasks and keys, audiobook, songs in Latin. The course consists of 25 video
lessons and, as is clear from its name, does not claim to academic depth.
The portal Internet Poliglot (https://www.internetpolyglot.com/) also offered lessons
in Latin in an interesting form. Users are encouraged to learn lexical units grouped by
relevant topics and illustrated by slides and MP3s, and then to test knowledge in the form
of games.
Besides several popular online resources for learning Latin are offered to a wide
audience, special courses for concrete specialties are presented. As a rule, they are
designed by teachers of educational establishments for students of part-time or distance
learning forms and implemented on the Moodle platform. There are also electronic
educational resources for distance support of the advanced study of Latin. For example,
such an electronic resource based on the famous N. Katsman textbook was developed by
D. Drozdova (DROZDOVA, 2011). The manual consists of 20 lessons, including the topic,
recommendations for the study of grammar theory, grammar and vocabulary exercises,
interactive control tests. In general, the resource seems prospective not only as a means
for learning Latin but also as a tool for the accumulation of several educational content in
the Latin language.
Among Ukrainian sites, Pinax (http://www.pinax.com.ua/) stands out. It provides
materials from the courses of Latin Language, Ancient Greek and Culture of Ancient
Greece and Rome by teachers of the Department of General Linguistics and Classical
Philology of the Institute of Philology of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.
Latin course contains Latin grammar tables, analysis of nouns and adjectives, samples of
exercises and tests, several articles, Latin phrases, versions of the anthem Gaudeamus
translated by famous Ukrainian poets and university students, etc.
In
2009,
the
Medievist.
Ukrainian
Latin
Literature
project
(https://www.medievist.org.ua/) was launched to combine the scientific works of modern
authors, original Latin texts and translations on the one resource. The site is a platform
where scholars can share their own works, communicate with colleagues, it’s designed to
carry out informational, innovative, and scientific missions. However, the specialists of the
site also offer educational services: Latin courses, consultations on topics of normative
grammar and syntax as well as in the field of medical, pharmaceutical, biological
terminology.
Many universities and other higher educational establishments propose their own
Latin courses developed on platforms Moodle and Ilias. For example, the Bukovinian State
Medical University (https://www.bsmu.edu.ua/en/) offers a distance learning Latin course
based on textbooks Studeamus Linguae Latinae, Fundamentals of Recipes, and Clinical

Terminology. The course contains 17 topics on the study of the module “Phonetics. The
structure of the anatomical-histological term”, 16 topics – on the module “Pharmaceutical
terminology” and lexical and analytical-syntactic elaboration of the topic “Clinical
terminology”.
Since the 2010s, the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of
Ukraine has continued a long-term pedagogical experiment on the effectiveness of the use
of e-learning tools in the veterinary students’ training. The aim of the experimental
research work was to carry out the system of pedagogical influence by means of elearning tools, which has to increase the retention level of learning material, minimize
didactic risks and improve the quality of the educational process in Ukrainian agrarian
universities. Defining the research problem, methodology, experimental design, developing
instruments, data collection and analysis were carried out by the author in the framework
of Ph.D. thesis (BALALAIEVA, 2016).
In particular, an electronic textbook Elementa Linguae Latinae designed by the
author’s model was used in learning Latin. This e-textbook has a modular structure and
there are two basic modules (Guide and Dictionary) and Help module in it (BALALAIEVA,
2019).
The Guide module contains a short course in Latin, in which basic phonetics and
grammar knowledge required for mastering the skills of reading, writing, translation, and
analysis of veterinary terms is provided in a concise and accessible form. The module
provides the implementation of information, systematization and self-control functions. The
information function is provided by fixing the substantive content of training at the level of
grammatical material and is realized through the availability of information on Latin
phonetics and grammar, as well as some professional topics; the systematization on is
implemented at the language level – the training material is structured according to the
subsystems of the language and presented in the format reference manual with cognitivegraphic models.
The Dictionary module consists of three sections: “Dictionary” itself (4000 entries),
“Terminological elements” (300 entries), and “Phrases” (300 entries). The information
function of the module is provided by fixing the substantive content of training at the level
of terminology material, is realized through the availability of Latin/Ukrainian term’s
equivalent, information about the origin of terminological elements, semantization, and
partial term interpretation. The dictionary in this aspect is considered as a source of
information, a means of access to accumulated empirical knowledge in the subject field.
The systematization function is implemented at two levels: language and terminology (a
term itself by its very nature is systematic and the semantization of the term in the
dictionary implies a description of a certain fragment of the terminology system).
The Help module contains general information about the textbook and program, a
description of the structure of the dictionary and entry, the user's guide, a list of conditional
abbreviations, references.
A total of 247 students of the faculty of veterinary medicine of NULES (National
University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine) participated in the experiment.
Students of the experimental group (n=123) trained using this tool and students of the
control group (n=124) trained in traditional ways were evaluated through a system of
standardized achievement tests in Latin language (data collection and analysis are
described in detail in BALALAIEVA, 2016).

The following criteria have been established for the effectiveness of learning:
motivation (indicators: focus and level of academic motivation), cognitive (indicators:
quality and amount of knowledge), and activity (indicators: mastering practical skills, speed
of execution of training tasks). The pedagogical experiment has proved the advantage of
teaching efficiency with the use of e-learning tools. In particular, a positive changes’
dynamic has been discovered in learning motivation focus, and in intrinsic motivation
levels redistribution. Comparative analysis of the dynamics of educational motivation
showed that the difference in the growth of the number of students with dominating
intrinsic motives is 10.4% for the experimental group. The effectiveness of e-learning tools’
use has been proved by the statistically significant increase of the retention level of
learning material in experimental groups (in general, the average score in the experimental
group is 0.51 higher than in the control one). The positive difference in learning was
ascertained in the experimental group: the number of students with middle and high level
of academic progress increased. In particular, the number of students with low progress in
the experimental group is 14.2% less than in the control one, but the number of students
with a middle and high levels of academic progress higher by 9.2% and 5% respectively.
Also, it was found that the overall speed of execution of training tasks in the experimental
group is 7.8% higher than in the control one.
As the final survey showed, the students in their work more often resorted to the
help of the Dictionary module, as is the case with online resources, among which
dictionaries are the most frequently used.

4 Dictionaries and translators
Online dictionaries and translators occupy a separate niche among electronic
resources.
The
Thesaurus
Linguae
Latinae
Online
(https://www.thesaurus.badw.de/en/project.html) is the largest and most detailed Latin
dictionary in the world, based on the renowned print dictionary, designed to serve as a tool
for both research and teaching preparation at the primary and university school levels,
supported by 31 academies and scholarly societies from over 23 countries.
William
Whitaker’s
WORDS
(https://mk270.github.io/whitakerswords/operational.html) is an electronic dictionary for translating from Latin to English and
vice versa. The computer program can parse variations of the forms of Latin words, give
possible interpretations (case, person, gender, tense, mood, etc.), translate roots.
According to the author, “the purpose of this dictionary in the overall scheme was to have a
variety of words and types, from which the algorithms for the codes could be developed,
and with which they could be exercised” (http://www.archives.nd.edu/words.htm). The
dictionary is intended for beginning Latin students or amateur, but it has become very
popular due to the wide coverage of the Latin vocabulary (about 39,000 entries) and
accurate translation.
William Whitaker’s WORDS provided the basis for many other dictionaries, for
instance, John Madsen Latin-English Dictionary (about 42,000 entries), Marco Waclawek
Latein-Wörterbuch (about 48,000 entries), etc.

One more product based on William Whitaker’s WORDS is NoDictionaries
(http://nodictionaries.com/) – a Latin dictionary look-up tool which generates an interlinear
word list. The module NoDictionaries: Latin Literature contains literal translations of 49
classic authors, the module NoDictionaries: Novifex allows generating interlinear word lists
of any text entered by the user.
Another product Blitz Latin (https://blitzlatin.com/), designed by White & Whitaker, is
able to translate automatically not only words but also texts from Latin to English. It
contains about 9,500 Latin standard phrases and more than 43,000 words. The specific
feature of the dictionary is its flexibility – for the accuracy of the translation, the user can
choose the period (classical or medieval), the sphere of language use (biological, medical,
linguistic, law, and technical), to review all alternative meanings of the word. The dictionary
offers three additional modules: HTMStrip – provides formatting of texts from HTML pages
into text ready for translation; Inscript – a quick search tool for the database of inscriptions
of Frankfurt University; Counter – counts Latin words in the text and provides statistical
analysis.
The Latin Lexicon. Numen (https://latinlexicon.org/) is an online Latin dictionary
based on some authoritative sources, in particular, An Elementary Latin Dictionary by
Charlton T. Lewis, A Latin Dictionary by Lewis & Short and Latinitas Recens. This online
dictionary has the fastest, efficient user interface and well-designed navigation system.
The program offers not only the translation of the word but also its whole derivational
paradigm and examples of use in the classical authors’ works. The built-in tutorial Word
study tool provides the ability to grammatically analyze words.
Classic dictionaries are also available online in a fully digitized and searchable form:
A
Copious
and
Critical
English-Latin
Dictionary
by
Smith
&
Hall
(https://www.latinitium.com/smithhall), A Latin Dictionary by Lewis & Short
(http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext
%3A1999.04.0059&redirect=true), etc.
It also should be mentioned online Latin-German dictionaries: Albert Martin Latein
Wörterbuch (https://www.albertmartin.de/latein/info.php) contains 36,500 entries, Auxilium
Lateinwörterbuch (http://www.auxilium-online.net/wb/formenanalyse.php) contains 16,000
entries, is able to translate and parse forms of Latin words; Latin-Italian: Olivetti Dizionario
Latino (https://www.dizionario-latino.com/dizionario-italiano-latino.php) – the largest online
Latin-Italian dictionary with a conjugator and declination tool included, Dizionario Latino
Italiano (https://www.gamoto.net/dizionario-latino/latino-italiano.htm); Latin-French: Olivetti
Dictionnaire Latin-Français (https://www.grand-dictionnaire-latin.com/dictionnaire-latinfrancais.php), Lexilogos (https://www.lexilogos.com/latin_dictionnaire.htm), Traducteur
Latin Français en ligne (https://www.webtran.fr/latin/a-francais/); Latin-Spanish: AULEX
(https://aulex.org/la-es/?idioma=en ),
ePrevodilac
Latin-Spanish
translator
(https://en.eprevodilac.com/);
Latin-Dutch:
Woordenboek
Latijn-Nederlands
(http://www.latijnnederlands.nl/);
Latin-Portuguese:
Dicionário
de
Latim
(https://www.dicionariodelatim.com.br/) – online Latin word and phrase dictionary with
meanings and definitions in Portuguese, etc.
Latin-Russian dictionaries are fairly well represented in the network. In addition to
previously mentioned e-dictionaries by I. Dvoretsky, M. Polyashev, the program Latrus 1.2
(http://latinum.ru/load/1) should be noted (it contains a Latin-Russian dictionary (12,600
entries), a dictionary of Latin phrases and a guide on Latin grammar).

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.12.3.93-108

Users are also offered terminological dictionaries. For example, the Latin-RussianLatin Anatomical Dictionary (http://www.ets.ru/pg/r/dict/anatomy.htm), the introduction of
which in the Polyglossum vocabulary program preceded its printed publication. The
authors of the dictionary aimed to conclude the maximum number of anatomical terms
(about 30,000 entries) necessary for medical students, as well as medical practitioners
and translators.
Latin became the 58th language proposed by Google Translate for direct and
reverse translation. However, as our practice shows, translations from Ukrainian to Latin
by Google Translate are far from perfect, as well as translations by other tools, such as the
translator
Pragma
6
(http://m.translate.ua/us),
multilingual
dictionary
(https://www.slovnyk.org/),
Латинсько-український
словник
(https://www.mtranslate.com.ua/slovnik/latin/la-uk).
The Ukrainian-Latin online dictionary on glosbe.com (8,260 phrases in the LatinUkrainian translation and 7,765 in reverse) offers a translation from Latin to Ukrainian,
possible word combinations, examples of the use of a word in a sentence. The
disadvantages include the macaronic Russian-English interface (of Latin-Ukrainian
dictionary!), in particular, the basic instructions are in Russian, and grammatical comments
are in English, and occasionally in Polish.
A computer program and a family of electronic dictionaries ABBYY Lingvo
developed by an ABBYY company has a huge database, but there are only 2 LatinUkrainian dictionaries in it: the selected Ukrainian part of Lexicon Heptaglotton,
reconstructed by the text of V. Svoboda Slavonic part of Oxford Heptaglotton: UkrainianLatin dictionary of the first half of the 17th century and Latin-Ukrainian/Ukrainian-Latin
dictionaries of clinical and pharmaceutical terms.

5 Conclusion
The general trends of implementation of information and communication
technologies in the educational area have considerably expanded the possibilities of
studying Latin, opened access to vast resources of libraries, allowed using the scientific
and educational potential and experience of teaching Latin in the leading world
universities.
The development of electronic resources for learning Latin is more advanced in
European countries that have a strong educational tradition of teaching classical
languages, as evidenced by the variety of products presented online (from entire platforms
and websites to particular online courses, e-textbooks, tutorials, interactive tests, drill-andpractice programs, conjugators, dictionaries and translators etc.). In the post-Soviet
countries (including Ukraine) the development of electronic content for learning Latin is
gaining momentum. Using best practices of colleagues could help Classical teachers to
effectively organize an educational process, diversify the set of tools, enhance their work,
design domestic products for learning Latin.
