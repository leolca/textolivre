{"title":"Transliteracy: Portuguese language teaching mediated by ICDT","language":"portuguese","abstract":" The arrival of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (ICDT) in the school context opens space for the centrality of teaching - which almost always falls on the figure of the teacher and / or the student - to be established in 'learning' as a processassmann2001. Thus, located in the area of ​​Applied Linguisticskleiman2007 and in the light of qualitative / interpretive and ethnographic researchdenzin2006, we aim to discuss how pedagogical practices anchored in the translocations can contribute, reciprocally, to the expanded critical training of the teacher and students, in Portuguese language classes in the 3rd grade of high school at a state school. The discussions were basically based on the concepts of transliteraciesthomas2007, culturecanclini2009, multimodal textribeiro2018, local knowledgebasilio2006 and multi-obstaclesrojo2013. From the analysis, we understand that an approach anchored in the transliteracies, mediated by TDIC and in its relationship with local knowledge, allows the valorization of the knowledge specific to each social group. As a result, the production of knowledge becomes a more meaningful process for the student, who ceases to be a mere recipient of content and starts to play an active role, sharing the responsibility for learning with the teacher.
