{"title":"Technological barriers: a limiting factor in the accessibility of people with disabilities","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This research aims to evaluate the literature on the technological barriers in Brazil aimed at People with Disabilities (PwD). SciELO Citation Index publications indexed in the Web of Science database since 2002 were used until 2019. Textual Statistical Analysis, Descending Hierarchical Classification and Similitude Analysis with Cloud of Words of 50 scientific articles on the subject in focus were carried out. The results show that the literature on technological barriers has a strong delineation in the area of education, mainly focused on higher education, with a focus on studying students with visual impairment in public universities. The literature on technological barriers for PwD is usually associated with other accessibility barriers, especially barriers in communications and information, and is rarely found as the only variable in accessibility studies. It would be relevant to expand the studies on technological barriers by analyzing the main collections indexed in Web of Science. This way, it would be possible to know what has been published in international journals.
