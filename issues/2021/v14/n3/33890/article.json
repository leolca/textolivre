{"title":"An analysis of social communicative acts among MMORPG players","language":"english","abstract":"This research aims to analyze the communicative acts used by video-game players to socialize with other ones in MMORPG. The method to analyze these communicative acts is based on the results obtained from a questionnaire in which MMORPG players participated by responding to a series of closed questions. This questionnaire focused on analyzing some of the participants’ socializing communication habits following the classification of [p. 26]guntermann1982, and it aims to determine how a series of variables interfere in the socializing process with other players. These variables determining how they interfere in the socializing process among MMORPG players are age, extroversion, experience, dedication, and languages spoken. Thus, our results show the correlation between the uses of different communicative acts to socialize with other virtual players according to the previous variables.
