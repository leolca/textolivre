{"title":"Fidelity and praxeologies in didactic applications developed for solving mathematical expressions","language":"spanish","abstract":"The results of a technological development were analyzed to verify their level of reliability regarding the mathematical knowledge taught in the classroom. The concept of fidelity was used a programming context, for it was designed and built in Python. The application has four important characteristics, Compatibility with student’s mobile devices being one of the most important. It can solve inquiries related to first-order linear differential equations. The mathematical technique it follows was taken from the Anthropological Theory of the Didactics. This paper is complemented by cross-referencing similar apps found on the internet. The findings encourage the use of mobile apps in the classroom, as they strengthen the student’s skills.
