{"title":"Research activities in the pandemic: the use of the PCIBEX online platform to do psycholinguistics experiments","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This paper has the main goal of analyzing and explaining the use of the web platform for doing psycholinguistics experiments online called Penn Controller for Ibex (PCIbex)zehr2018. To illustrate its use, we presented an experiment developed for the research: “Processamento de sentenças e Foco: estudos de interface na Psicolinguística experimental”. For further exemplification of the platform, we compared it to another similar tool called PsychoPypeirce2007. This study proves itself relevant because the literature in Portuguese about this platform is scarce. As a result, we aim to contribute to the dissemination of PCIbex in the Brazilian research community.  ","keywords":"Online experiments, PCIbex, Psycholinguistics, Sentence processing","authors":[{
