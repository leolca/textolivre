{"title":"The digital competence of secondary school literature teachers in Spain","language":"spanish","abstract":"This research arises from the interest of knowing the digital competence of secondary school teachers who teach literature in Spain. Given the multidimensional nature of this competence, the study seeks to look specifically at the level of knowledge and the use of ICT educational resources in the literature classroom. To do this, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 71 active teachers from Spanish schools, whose specialty is Spanish Language and Literature. The statistical data analysis (descriptive, Student’s t-test, chi-squared and Pearson’s r) revealed significant information regarding, on the one hand, aspects such as the low percentage of teachers who intend to train themselves in ICT, the relationships between the use of ICT resources and the gender and age variables; and on the other, the types of educational centres and their locations as well as how useful secondary school teachers consider working with specific ICT educational resources.  Their use of ICT educational resources in relation to the different elements of literary education were also assessed.
