{"title":"Digital games and accent mark: possible connections between learning and playfulness","language":"portuguese","abstract":"Although digital games have been seeing in a pejorative way by parents and teachersleffa2012, they are teaching-learning objects that can benefit reading and writingribeiro2016. With regard to accent mark, it is common to hear some teachers statements about the absence and/or wrong use of accent mark in formal texts written by studentscouto+guimaraes2020. Considering this context, this paper articulates accent mark – which presents itself as a difficult teaching content – and games – tools capable of contributing to a pleasurable learning experience. Thus, the objective was to analyze digital games in accent mark learning, in order to discuss the possible connections between learning and playfulness inherent (or not) to them. This work is based on theories about digital gamesleffa2012, ribeiro2013, ribeiro2016 and the teaching-learning of accent markmarra2012, couto+guimaraes2020, cristofaro2020. Methodologically, it is a descriptive-interpretative investigation with a qualitative approachpaiva2019. The results showed that the analyzed games were built under the aegis of mechanical teaching and decontextualized writing, with a focus on memorization, and provide a timid learning with minimal or no playfulness.
