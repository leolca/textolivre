{"title":"Main directions of literacy studies in Brazil","language":"spanish","abstract":"In this paper, we contextualize the literacy studies in Brazil, providing the main lines of research and theoretical frameworks. The study is bibliographical with a qualitative-interpretative approach. First, we searched the literature for references related to literacy studies and the links to different research lines, such as academic literacy, school literacy, teacher’s literacy, digital literacy, literary literacy, and scientific literacy. Then, a parameterized consult was carried out on the website of the Directory of Research Groups in Brazil, from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, to identify the lines of research and their respective research groups related to literacy studies in Brazil. The study revealed that there are enough references on the subject and the prospects for literacy research reinforce the importance and contributions of the research originated in the New London Group and the New Literacy Studies.
