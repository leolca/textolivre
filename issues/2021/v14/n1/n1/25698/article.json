{"title":"Environmental educational practices in training children's educators","language":"portuguese","abstract":"Having a focus on the systemic perspective the permanent training of environmental childhood educators can bring a powerful multidisciplinary relationship between languages and children's education. The aim of this study is to investigate the environmental educational practices of childhood educators and their perspectives based on experiences in multiple contexts and cultures. The research is qualitative whose theoretical basis is the intertwining of concepts of the Biology of Knowledge and the Bioecology of Human Development. Ecological Engagement was the methodology through which the researcher included himself in the spaces of training to design the communication and reflection workshops. They were inspired in Non-Violent Communication. The analysis of information production was done with the support of the Sobek tool. Therefore the educational trajectories are mobilized by the possibility of conversation (action). Thus, the contribution of a bioecological view and the experiential proposal of educational environmental practices influence the constitution of children seducators.
