{"title":"Construction and reframing of technological practices in school environments: the rhizome as methodological path","language":"spanish","abstract":"The point of view locating a cultural constructions and resignifications of the technological practices of young people from the school dynamics. The present article is oriented from the problematization of fields to characterize and recognize forms of cultural constructions, resignifications and reinterpretation of related events and concepts by questioning and reflecting on eight technological practices. The review raises four lines of inquiry: (1) subjectivities, youth, and digital technologies; (2) youth and digital communication scenarios; (3) political and educational culture in technological mediations; and (4) ICT and education. The theoretical framework is based on the relationships between technology, culture, information society and control society, which converge on the educational, communicative and technological fact. The methodological perspective revolves around a rhizomatic proposal to build an investigative path, which implies defining it as a composition in favor of the claim of subjectivity. This attends to the meeting as a possibility and to becoming as methodological, based on the ideas of Deleuze and Guattari. Three types of conclusions are raised: the first has to do with the researcher-writer; the second, with diversified cultural constructions; and the third, with the application of the methodological perspective with its variables.
