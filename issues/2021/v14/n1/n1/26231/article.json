{"title":"Socioecological crisis and communications during the Red Tide of Chiloé (2016)","language":"spanish","abstract":"What role does the media assume during social conflicts in Chile? Delimiting to the socio-ecological crisis of Chiloé in 2016, this study set out to present a content analysis of the television broadcast covering its main milestones. Data for this study were collected using a sampling design formulated for the empirical comparison of journalistic material based on its normative criteria, type of media, and stage of development. Theoretically, the analysis integrates Luhmannian and Marxist p erspectives on the crisis, communication, and socio-ecological relations. As a whole, it articulates an interdisciplinary product of social sciences and communication. Its results problematize the succession of collisions of cognitive-normative expectations, or in other words, the unfolding of ideological battles during an episode of class struggle.
