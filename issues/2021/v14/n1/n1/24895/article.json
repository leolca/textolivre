{"title":"Exploring mathematics and physics with line follower robot from the perspective of free robotics","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This work provides a tool for exploring mathematical contents in an exciting way. It is a challenge for Basic Education teachers to foster the active participation of students in building their own knowledge. In this context, the production of instruments that facilitate innovation in mathematics classes is relevant. The investigation, on which this text is based, was developed from a bibliographic research and the construction/experimentation of a line follower robot, in the perspective of the reuse of scrap and exploration of the underlying mathematics. As a result, a proposal for didactic support material is presented, where the construction of a totally sustainable line follower is treated and possibilities for approaching different contents are described, showing problems which constitute mathematical and physical challenges. Other strengths of the proposal are: to enable access to the contributions of this approach in public education and to raise awareness of the need to preserve the environment, reusing electronic materials in the production of robots and the approach of correct disposal of materials that will not be (re)used.
