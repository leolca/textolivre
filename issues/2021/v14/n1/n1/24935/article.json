{"title":"Using Wikiversity in teaching scientific journalism: openness, collaboration and connectivism","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This article aims at critically presenting a case study about the creation of an online, open and collaborative course of introduction to scientific journalism. It begins showing the context in which the project was conceived and then briefly talks about the triad “communication, education and technology”, emphasizing technology's role in distance education, which can be seen from the historical perspective of “generations of technological innovation”. In the current context, with the Internet's advent and practices related to the 2.0 Web, this case deepens the description of a course, hosted at Wikiversity, and on its creation processes.
