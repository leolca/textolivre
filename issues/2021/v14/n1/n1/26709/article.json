{"title":"Drivers of the adoption of non-traditional methodologies: case study in the master- integrated of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University Of Trás-Os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal","language":"portuguese","abstract":"The study analyzed several instruments of the master-integrated course in Electrical and Computer Engineering at a Portuguese Public University. The institutional drivers responsible for adopting new methodologies in the course were evaluated. A case study was carried out with a qualitative approach based on mixed methods: a statistical analysis applied to textual corpus and complemented by content analysis. As a result, two classes of content analysis emerged: skills and knowledge expected from students; and aspects of training in Electrical Engineering and the study cycle. Seven drivers were identified for the adoption of new methodologies in the course, based on the theories of diffusion of innovation and institutional theory: training, development, competence, study cycle, new, technology, and UC. Each of these drivers has its outcomes, 16 in total, which shows the effects perceived by the teachers, course coordinators and evaluators.
