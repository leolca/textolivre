{"title":"University, literacies and new technologies in rural education contexts","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This work brings reflections about the literacies connected to the academic and digital spheres from a group of undergraduate students of a course for language teachers in rural contexts in Brazil. As a main objective, it will be presented how, in the students' discourse, the university provides literacy events and their relations with new technologies. The research methodology relies on the analysis of technobiographies which, understood as biographical narratives of the student's relations with new technologies, can bring relevant information in order to understand the relationship of the future teachers not only with academic literacies, but also its relationship with technologies. Itâ€™s noted that many of them have their first experiences with genres from the academic and digital spheres once they come to the university, through methodologies that prove to be quite productive. As a result, they expand not only their skills for the literate practices needed in their new spheres of interaction, but their readings of a set of meanings involved in these new contexts.
