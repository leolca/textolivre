{"title":"Remote teaching and reframing of practices and roles in education","language":"portuguese","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led the entire world to an intense period of change and adaptation in all sectors. In Brazil, education has undergone important transitions, in which it was necessary, among others, to transpose classroom teaching into virtual environments. This, without the acquisition of resources, training or prior planning. This emergency situation led private and public schools, as well as government agencies, to face the need to rethink the work that was being done, so that students could continue their studies remotely. Thus, this article brings a discussion around the role of technologies in education in times of crisis, thinking about the need to redefine practices and roles in the teaching and learning process, in parallel with the reality experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in 2020, towards possible contributions to the future educational scenario. Qualitative research is carried out, with bibliographic research and discourse analysis based on elements of French Semiotics. It highlights the importance of reframing the roles of the school and the family in the teaching and learning process, as well as cooperation between all, aiming at the autonomy and protagonism of the learners in the information age.
