{"title":"Scientific production of flipped learning and flipped classroom in Web of Science","language":"english","abstract":"This study focuses on knowing the scientific production of the terms flipped learning and flipped classroom in specialized literature, determining their conceptual evolution, the most relevant topics and the most prolific authors. A bibliometric study has been carried out supported by a structural and dynamic analysis of co-words. Both terms have been analyzed in the Web of Science, reporting 2968 documents and observing a much higher production in the flipped classroom. Despite the fact that both terminologies are frequently used as synonyms, in the scientific community they are differentiated, observing different trends and fields of study according to the concept. The results may promote the search for a terminological consensus that clearly delimits the area covered by each concept.
