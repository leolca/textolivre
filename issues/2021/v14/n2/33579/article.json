{"title":"Analysis of a Portuguese HEI teachers experience in the context of COVID-19","language":"english","abstract":"The current context of the pandemic crisis has led to unexpected educational changes. It has forced the institutions to rapidly adapt their teaching and learning methodologies in all areas, especially in higher education. This atypical situation, has given rise to numerous reflections on the ability of institutions to adapt to this new paradigm. This research aims to understand how the Portuguese Higher Education Institution (Polytechnic of Guarda) teachers have adjusted their teaching and learning process to distance learning. We constructed a quantitative investigation with a survey applied to the population, consisting of 158 individuals, achieving 102 valid answers, 65% of the population. The results show that despite the initial doubts and concerns at the beginning of the process, there was always a substantial increase in work volume. There was a rapid adaptation to new teaching and learning methodologies in COVID-19 time. Overall, most of the inquiries considered this distance learning experience to be very positive.
