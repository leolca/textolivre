{"title":"COVID-19 and its impact on educational work with older people","language":"spanish","abstract":"The purpose of this work is to vindicate the right to Education, if we want a true society for all ages. However, it is found that this right has been violated by COVID-19. This is an aspect on which the text reflects, questioning the modes of educational intervention developed during the pandemic with the group of older people. After briefly describing the state of affairs, the study provides a theoretical framework that justifies the analysis of the contextual aspects, together with the objectives and considerations to mitigate the effects of confinement on the senior population.. It is concluded that it is essential to guarantee the right to education throughout life in the institutional context, as well as a series of recommendations about strategies and resources to continue learning in a post-pandemic situation.
