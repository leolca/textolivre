{"title":"ITC and family leisure during confinement: agents involved","language":"spanish","abstract":"In order to clarify the role of different agents in relation to family leisure from the perspective of parents and children, this study was carried out on a total sample of 763 parents and 286 children living in Spain, who completed a Likert-type questionnaire from 1 to 5, assessing the role played by the following agents: new technologies, school, public administration, associations, the media and the family itself, as well as indicating age and number of family members. The results show that younger parents have a more optimistic view of the agents and, especially, of new technologies, in contrast to older parents who are sceptical about them. In the case of children, their perception is worse as they get older, with a more positive view among adolescents. Dwellings with more family members appreciate the role played by agents and see new technologies as a useful support resource for family leisure. In this way, re-education policies and interventions should be promoted to banish the single vision of these media as a source of rupture between family members.
