{"title":"Multimodal literacy and pluriliteracy in the Primary School classroom through a transmedia narrative \textit{El niño, el topo, el zorro y el caballo}, by Charlie Mackesy","language":"spanish","abstract":"El niño, el topo, el zorro y el caballo by mackesy_nino_2020 is a picture book and a transmedia fable about a boy and his adventures with three friends from the animal kingdom. More than a linear narrative, it is a collection of transcendental conversations relevant to readers of all ages, since it communicates universal values such as friendship or self-esteem. Specifically, during the pandemic, this book acquired significant relevance due to the lessons on overcoming that emanate from its pages. This article considers the work in the light of the following constructs: transmediality, multimodal literacy, interculturality, translanguaging and pluriliteracy. A revision of these concepts is followed by pedagogical orientations for the use of this fable in the Primary School Classroom. Mackesy's work is revealed as an ideal resource for the didactic development of the aforementioned constructs as promoted by current curricula, adapting them to the new educational environments of reading.   ","keywords":"Primary Education, Picture books, Transmediality, Multimodal literacy, Plurititeracy","authors":[{
