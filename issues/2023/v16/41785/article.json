{"title":"The need for linguistic decolonialism on English subtitling","language":"spanish","abstract":"Television series and movies are increasingly being broadcast in English through subtitled audio and written material, thus increasing the use, selection and learning of the English language. The objective of this article is to unravel, from the perspective of linguistic decolonialism, how English is socioculturally imposed as a natural choice. Methodologically, this is a qualitative study, using interviews with Peruvian translators, language teachers and students. The article concludes that the demand for subtitles facilitates teaching English as a colonial practice and proposes decolonizing alternatives, some descriptive and other critical, in the face of its massive diffusion.
