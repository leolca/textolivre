{"title":"Latin American dialogues and Spanish language learning: report of Teletandem experience at UFCG","language":"portuguese","abstract":"This article aims to present the intercultural experience of Teletandem involving students from two Brazilian federal universities. Following the methodological approach of the experience reportmussi_pressupostos_2021, we developed a collaborative academic-reflexive essay that emerges from a virtual foreign language practice within the Spanish I course at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). Inspired by the philosophy of Paulo Freire, we discuss how this tool can foster the teaching and learning of foreign languages, creating authentic interaction scenarios among students and promoting autonomy, reciprocity, and peer collaboration. Simultaneously, we identify some challenges and potential obstacles that may interfere with the activity. We conclude that Teletandem emerges as a powerful intercultural activity capable of fostering exchange and reflection on the demands and challenges faced by rural populations in Latin America.
