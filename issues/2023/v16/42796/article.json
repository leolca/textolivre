{"title":"The post-covid Jordanian university context and problems of online assessment","language":"french","abstract":" During the distance education process, the question that has not ceased to be asked within the faculty and that has worried many students and their parents is the evaluation and relevance of the student's learning mechanisms. What methods can be used to compensate for face-to-face teaching? Education experts answered this question and assured that there are several methods and mechanisms. However, what is its relevance and effectiveness? Quantitative advances in technology have not kept pace with qualitative advances in applying this technology to assessment and testing. Institutions' inability to properly use this technology has resulted in poor educational outcomes. This article studies the assessment and testing process to identify the gap between theory and practice and to highlight weaknesses and problems that have weakened the assessment and testing process. This study is based on a survey whose results are analyzed using the SPSS program. The study sample consists of 88 professors from various departments of modern languages in Jordanian universities who worked during the second semester of the 2022 academic year. To build this sample, we randomly selected 88 professors among the 120 who answered the questionnaire. The descriptive analytical method was chosen for the research because of its applicability to the general scope of the research. Discussions will follow the results to assess the situation where problems related to the university environment are found first in terms of problems related to technology use, compared to those related to teachers or students, with a mean of 3.99 and a high score.
