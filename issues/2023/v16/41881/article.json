{"title":"Public sphere and disinformation in a local context","language":"portuguese","abstract":"Disinformation is not a new phenomenon. Even so, in recent years its relevance on the public agenda has increased, as the victory of Brexit supporters in the UK or the election of Donald Trump for US president have shown. Academic interest runs in parallel to the consideration of disinformation as a growing priority for governments and international organizations. On the other hand, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the decline of regional media, already affected by the digital transformation and declining business models, now challenged by the platforms, which became essential mediators in the advertising market. The decline of regional media leaves communities in a state of serious vulnerability as information is increasingly consumed through social media, where disinformation easily proliferates. As in the pandemic context, disinformation is also a virus that spreads quickly and has a high potential for damage to democracy, namely at a local level. It is precisely where we intend to focus the debate, curiously where it has been little present. It is precisely from the local public sphere that responses to disinformation can emerge,  especially in a collaborative relationship between journalists and (other) active members of the community.
