{"title":"The animation ``Purl'': an analysis from the perspective of Sociointeractional Semiotics","language":"english","abstract":"Considering the assumption that the primary responsibility of educational institutions is to develop citizens, we understand that the discussion of sometimes controversial topics can contribute to the refinement of social relations. We argue that the animation genre can be an excellent resource to encourage this type of reflection in a playful and appealing way. Therefore, this text analyzes the short film purl, which addresses the theme of sexism in the corporate world. To this end, we adopt the sociointeractional semiotics analysis model as our theoretical framework, developed by leal2011organizaccao, based on concepts from socio-discursive interactionism - SDIbronckart2012 and the grammar of visual design - GVDkress2006reading. At the end of the article, we present considerations regarding the possibilities of working with multiliteracies, using animation as a tool for working with language practices in the classroom, guided by a perspective that can effectively contribute to the development of critical subjects and citizens.
