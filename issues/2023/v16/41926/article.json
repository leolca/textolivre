{"title":"The non-fiction picturebook in reader training: analysis of the discursive and cultural keys to reading in the digital society","language":"spanish","abstract":"In the theoretical framework defined by the research of wolf_lector_2020,delgado_dont_2018,gil_lectura_2020, among others, the need to combine digital and analogue paradigms in order to develop the 'biliterate brain'wolf_lector_2020 that the digital society demands is essential in the training of readers. This article proposes the analysis of a corpus of thirty non-fiction picturebooks published in the last fifteen years with the aim of identifying the main keys to reading these works. Thus, overcoming the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, biased information, materiality as the axis of discourse construction, fragmented and non-linear reading, the importance of peritexts, the hybridisation of paradigms and the cultural dimension are some of the features that emerge from the analysis carried out. These results propose a model reader that can be understood from the parameters of a new literary practice.
