{"title":"Training and digital competence of secondary education teachers in Spain","language":"spanish","abstract":"The digital competence of teachers is a key element of the quality of education systems today. Under this approach, this text reviews the integration of technological content in initial teacher training as a starting point for their technological training. It also explores the frameworks of reference for digital competence in teaching that identify the skills that teachers need to have in order to carry out their work and crosses both issues with the current situation revealed by the scientific literature on the digital skills of both trainee and practising teachers. The results show that there is a scarce implementation of technology in the training plans leading to teaching performance and that the approaches imposed by institutional frameworks are too broad compared to the technological skills of teachers, clearly identifying areas for improvement that require the establishment of continuous training.
