{"title":"Reading promotion and transmedia. From editorial creation to the book-trailer as a fictional expitext","language":"spanish","abstract":"This paper aims to analyse the profile of the virtual epitexts that appear in four educational publishing platforms for the promotion of books. Being aware that we are immersed in a gaseous societyscolari2021  where the brief, fashions and the viral predominate; the new  reading paradigm corresponds to an analogue-digital hybridisation in which book-trailers become a clear example of a transmedia product of the original text by publishers. Our qualitative research is based on a corpus analysis of 70 fictional epitexts, by means of a list of contents divided into three study categories. The results show their presence in both children's and young adultâ€™s literature books in order to encourage reading and to bring forth curiosity and enjoyment in the prosumer. However, it is also necessary to highlight that this type of multimodal techniques and languages cannot supplant the protagonism of the literary fact and reading itself.
