{"title":"A tourist route recommender system based on collaborative filtering","language":"portuguese","abstract":"Planning a trip, whether as a tourist or work, may not be a simple task. Buying tickets, finding accommodations available, and selecting places to visit, this whole process can be very exhausting considering the number of online platforms that offer services in the tourist scope and also the overload of information in web search engines.
