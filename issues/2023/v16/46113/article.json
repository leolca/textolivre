{"title":"The Automated Guided Vehicle as a mathematical learning microworld: a constructionist perspective","language":"portuguese","abstract":"The article sought to explore, from a constructionist perspective, the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) as a Microworld for mathematical learning. Its constitution took place from qualitative exploratory research, in which an overview of the object is offered. In this process, bibliographical research was conducted, based on studies by authors such as Seymour Papert, Pierre Lèvy and marked by experimentation based on Guimaraes2020. Thus, the objective was to study the feasibility of adopting AGV as a Microworld for mathematical learning, from the perspective of bricolage, simulation, and creative intelligence. The experience with the construction of AGV is more than the construction of a robot, it is the affirmation of the importance of Mathematics, virtual simulation in the conception of the real, and the tangible.
