{"title":"Transmedia expansion of a story to develop literary interpretation","language":"spanish","abstract":"The objective of this research is to describe the didactic function of the transmedia expansion of a story for the development of literary interpretation. To this end, a didactic sequence was designed and implemented oriented to the production of transmedia storytelling of the story “Bocas cosidas”, carried out by teachers in Chile during the lockdown, in 2020. The methodology used is the systematization of experiences and the thematic analysis of the creations. The results show that transmedia production contributes to the development of literary interpretation. The indicators taken into account were the definition of the theme of transmedia storytelling, the expansion of the narrative world of the story, the audiovisual elements used, the allusions to their reading intertext and the relations of intertextuality established.
