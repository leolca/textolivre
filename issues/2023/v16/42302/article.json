It aims to present the development of computational tools capable of processing dialectal and lexicographic data using a methodology that does not require the hiring of programming services, inviting the researcher to study the necessary computer resources to perform an automatic manipulation of information in a database. For this purpose, the corpus used was Atlas Linguístico do Brazil Projectcomite2001 relating to the interior municipalities from the ALiB, network, pointed out in the country’s North region. The construction of these small programs was mainly motivated by two reasons: i) provide lexicographical and electronic treatment to ALiB dialect data; ii) develop their own computational tools to meet the Doctoral research goals in progress, to which this article is linked. Thus, a database in Extensible Markup Language (XML) was built to store dialectal information in lexicographical format, and through the execution of code lines, it was possible to electronically retrieve specific data from the corpus and filter the results based on 'gender', 'age', and 'location' variants present in the data from the ALiB corpus.
