ABSTRACT: A considerable number of studies on mobile-assisted language learning have
been conducted, but less attention has been paid to online informal learning of English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) performed using smartphones among undergraduate EFL
learners in Indonesia. Thus, this study was specifically aimed at investigating EFL learners’
most frequently-performed EFL learning activities through smartphones, the predominant
online language use, and the relationship between EFL learners’ predominant online
language use and their perceived EFL proficiency. The study adopted a quantitative
approach. The findings reveal that the participants still more frequently access content and
information from their smartphones for receptive rather than interactive/productive online
activities. Indonesian, which is the participants’ first language, is still predominantly used
for their online activities. The mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of those who
frequently perform online activities in English is statistically and significantly higher than
those performing online activities in Indonesian. Overall, the mean score of the perceived
EFL proficiency of those performing online activities in English is higher than those in
Indonesian, although the difference is not statistically significant. Finally, the study’s
implications with suggestions for future research are discussed.

RESUMO: Um número considerável de estudos sobre o aprendizado de idiomas assistido
por celular foi realizado, mas menos atenção foi dada ao aprendizado informal online do
Inglês como Língua Estrangeira (ILE), realizado usando smartphones entre os alunos de
graduação em ILE na Indonésia. Assim, este estudo teve como objetivo específico
investigar as atividades de aprendizagem de ILE mais frequentemente realizadas pelos
alunos de ILE por meio de smartphones, o uso predominante de idiomas online e a

relação entre o uso predominante de idiomas online dos aprendentes de ILE e sua
percepção de proficiência em ILE. O estudo adotou uma abordagem quantitativa. As
descobertas revelam que os participantes acessam com mais frequência conteúdo e
informações de seus smartphones para atividades online receptivas, em vez de
interativas/produtivas. O Indonésio, que é o primeiro idioma dos participantes, ainda é
usado predominantemente em suas atividades online. A pontuação média da proficiência
percebida no ILE daqueles que frequentemente realizam atividades online em inglês é
estatisticamente e significativamente maior do que aqueles que realizam atividades online
na Indonésio. No geral, a pontuação média da proficiência percebida no ILE daqueles que
realizam atividades online em inglês é mais alta do que na indonésia, embora a diferença
não seja estatisticamente significativa. Finalmente, são discutidas as implicações do
estudo, com sugestões para futuras pesquisas.

1 Introduction
Today, researchers have been increasingly interested in investigating various
potentials of technology in the age of the fourth industrial revolution, which is also referred
to as Industry 4.0 (HARIHARASUDAN; KOT, 2018). The Industry 4.0 is said to not only
have an effect on people, business, and governance, but it also has a huge amount of
influence over education (HARIHARASUDAN; KOT, 2018), which then the term Education
4.0 came into existence. This term emphasizes that technology should be aligned with
human and education to enable new potential possibilities (HUSSIN, 2018). In other
words, technology should be utilized to help students acquire knowledge that changes to
the curriculum are highly required in order for students to develop their capacity
(PENPRASE, 2018). Therefore, technology is believed to play an important role and give
positive impacts on education in general (HARIHARASUDAN; KOT, 2018) and on
language learning in particular (SAMIRA, 2011).
There is now much evidence to support great importance of technology on
language learning, particularly on English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning. Çiçek
(2005); Ebadi and Goodarzi (2017); Hsu (2016); Jalali and Dousti (2014); Öz (2015) state
that EFL learners have a positive attitude to computer-assisted language learning (CALL).
Learners are also reported having positive attitudes toward web-based English learning
(YAO, 2016) and power-point presentation (MOHSENZADEH; MARZBAN; EBRAHIMI,
2014). Besides CALL and web-based EFL learning technologies, social media and mobile
technologies are also reported playing a noticeable role in EFL learning (DASHTESTANI,
2013; ALSHABEB; ALMAQRN, 2018).
University students are reported having a positive perception on mobile-assisted
language learning (MALL) (WAN AZLI; SHAH; MOHAMAD, 2018) because mobile devices
can effectively be used to disseminate, train, improve, and maintain non-native speakers’
linguistic competence (ALI; MIRAZ, 2018). Duman, Orhon and Gedik (2015) found that the
use of mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile phones for teaching vocabulary has been
a popular topic over the period of 2000-2012. Bozdoğan (2015) also reveals that in the
period of 2010-2015 the well-known MALL phenomena have been favorite topics of
analyses for several research purposes such as skill-based language learning, learning
104

factors, integrating social media into learning, design and development of mobile
applications. Burston (2013) reported that the well-known MALL topics have also been
favorite topics for investigation over the past two decades (1994-2012) related to technical
issues, mobile devices ownership, learning theory, pedagogical design, users’ attitudes,
motivation, institutional infrastructure, and teacher training. He further added that the most
frequently published type of MALL studies is related to “project implementation
descriptions” (BURSTON, 2013, p. 157).
Learning through mobile devices is not without limitations, but it has more
advantages and is much cheaper compared to computers. Almost all students own them
and they can access their mobile device from anywhere and at any time (ELAISH; SHUIB;
GHANI; YADEGARIDEHKORDI; ALAA, 2017). As reported, 40 per cent of young people
and adults use their smartphones for more than four hours each day for making calls and
sending messages (TORRECILLAS, 2007 as cited in CHA; SEO, 2018). Worldwide, these
mobile devices were used by around 1.85 billion people in 2014, which is expected to be
2.32 billion in 2017 and 2.87 billion in 2020 (STATISTA, 2017 as cited in CHA; SEO, 2018).
It is reported that by 2016 100 per cent of Indonesian university students from high socioeconomic status have a smartphone, 94.12 per cent of those coming from middle to low
socio-economic status are also reported having the mobile device (PRATAMA, 2017), and
55.49 per cent of them use their time for more than five hours doing something on their
mobile devices every day (PRATAMA, 2018).
Studies about language teaching and learning suggest three main groups of
learning including learning which takes place in a formal context (formal learning), learning
which takes place in a non-academic context (non-formal learning), and learning which
takes place naturally outside of any institutional settings using resources which are not
specifically aimed at educational purposes (informal learning). The process of informal
learning occurs unconsciously and, in the context of English online informal learning, it
involves the Internet-based resources for English learning (SOCKETT, 2014) through
smartphones. The phrase “informal learning” is a term used to “describe the way in which
exposure to English outside the classroom may lead to acquisition of the language”
(SOCKETT, 2014, p. 8) and young people love spending more hours to learn English
online than in formal, institutional settings (TOFFOLI; SOCKETT, 2015 as cited in
TRINDER, 2017). Moving from understanding of what language learners do in their spare
time to understanding how their acquisition is influenced by the situation refers to what is
known as “incidental acquisition” (SOCKETT, 2014). Ellis also stated that “incidental
acquisition” is the most important part among other types of language learning, which
includes learning in formal contexts (ELLIS, 1994 as cited in SOCKETT, 2014). Informal
learning is learner-controlled taking place beyond the classroom which is not linked to any
courses and/or institution. It is not well structured and in most cases
non-intentional/incidental (STEVENS, 2009 as cited in TRINDER, 2017).
Thus, it can be said that a considerable number of studies on MALL have been
conducted, but less attention has been paid to online informal EFL learning through
smartphones as the most popular mobile device today. In other words, there is a lack of
evidence to show that EFL learners in the Indonesian context perform online informal
learning activities through their smartphones. The only reported study, to our knowledge,
investigated learners’ predominant language use for their online informal learning activities
in EFL context through smartphones (PUTRAWAN; RIADI, 2020). Therefore, this study
made an attempt to investigate online informal learning activities performed by Indonesian
105

EFL learners through their smartphones that focused on their frequently-performed online
activities, their predominant online language use, and the comparison of perceived EFL
proficiency of those who frequently perform online activities in Indonesian and those in
English.

2 Literature review
The term online informal learning of English (OILE) refers to “a complex range of
Internet-based activities” in which “people carrying out these online activities are not
primarily seeking to learn English through them although language development may be
taking place” (SOCKETT, 2014, p. 7). These activities are done outside the classroom
setting (WILSEY, 2014) by communicating or interacting with native speakers or getting
exposure to the authenticity of language input (BAHRANI; Sim, 2012) and it is generally
accepted that language learning is one of disciplines that derive much benefit from the
mobile learning and technology (KUKULSKA-HULME, 2015). The informal learning can
also be said to take place in an informal setting which is self-directed by learners and they
are responsible for the initiatives and activities they do towards their own learning
(ROSELL-AGUILAR, 2018). Therefore, learners of both EFL and English as a second
language (ESL) are advised to take advantage of authentic language input either inside or
outside the classroom (BAHRANI; SIM; NEKOUEIZADEH, 2014) to get the opportunity to
communicate with the real world (POPESCU, 2012).
The study on technology use in online informal learning of EFL has become an
important aspect of investigation. Rosell-Aguilar (2018) argued that social media such as
Twitter and Facebook can be utilized for formal and informal learning. The online informal
learning through social media can be also used as supplementary media for formal
learning in the classroom that “increases learners’ awareness to language learning
opportunities and continuous learning process” (ALADJEM; JOU, 2016, p. 161). Bahrani
and Sim (2012) conducted research on informal language learning setting which attempted
to investigate the effects of exposure (either technology or social interaction) on English
speaking proficiency. They found that EFL participants with an exposure to audio-visual
mass media performed better at speaking compared to ESL participants who were
exposed to social interaction as their source of language input.
Lai, Hu and Lyu (2018) who examined learning experiences employed by language
learners from outside the classroom as well as the influencing factors identified three kinds
of experiences which include instructional-, entertainment-, and information-oriented
technological experiences. The three kinds of technological experiences were affected by
a variety of attitudinal and support factors. Findings by Trinder (2017) suggest that
seventy-two per cent of the subjects under his study confirmed that they intentionally get
involved in online activities with a specific purpose of improving certain English language
aspects such as vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Language learning through
mobile phones is also positively perceived by learners as a useful method form improving
their reading and grammar competences (WANG; SMITH, 2013). Engaging in a variety of
informal digital learning of English (IDLE) activities with a focus on form and meaning
could also significantly predict EFL learners’ speaking proficiency (LEE; DRESSMAN,
2018).
A very few researchers have turned to the investigation of informal learning of EFL
106

Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 3, p. 103-120, set.-dez. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.35699/1983-3652.2020.24657

which is performed online through smartphones. Jurkovič (2019) found that EFL learners
still retrieve online content from their smartphones for receptive such as reading emails,
listening to music, and reading comments on social media, rather than
interactive/productive online activities such as writing short text messages, communicating
with classmates regarding study-related materials, and writing emails, and the participants’
first language is predominantly used for their online activities. Putrawan and Riadi (2020)
who conducted preliminary research on the predominant language use for online learning
activities found that English is not predominantly used by EFL learners in the Indonesian
context. Sierocka, Jurković and Varga (2019) found that the subjects under their
investigation use smartpones for receptive online activities more frequently, but they
infrequently use their smartphones for the purpose of learning a language. They further
stated that the predominant use of either first language or English for online informal
learning activities does not significantly make an impact on the participants’ self-assessed
English competence.
It is also found that smartphones play a significant role to boost learners’ critical
thinking, creative thinking, and increase their communication and collaboration skills
(RAMAMURUTHY; RAO, 2015) because the use of smartphone for English learning can
make them become an autonomous learner (NURHAENI; PURNAWARMAN, 2018). It
indicates that mobile learning through smartphones allows learners to get out of the
classroom to deal with the real world (STOCKWELL, 2010). Thus, the use of mobile
devices, especially smartphones, “is one of the principal enablers of the growth in online
informal learning (GODWIN-JONES, 2017b as cited in GODWIN-JONES, 2019, p. 15).

3 Research questions
To date less attention has been paid to online informal learning of EFL through
smartphones among undergraduate EFL learners in Indonesia. Thus, the aims of this
study are specifically to address the following questions:
(1) What are the most frequently-performed EFL learning activities through
smartphones among undergraduate EFL learners in Indonesia?
(2) What is the predominant online language use through smartphones among
undergraduate EFL learners in Indonesia?
(3) Do EFL learners with different predominat language use (Indonesian predominant
language use and that of English) for their online informal learning activities differ in
their perceived EFL proficiency?

4 Methodology
4.1

Participants

A total of 173 undergraduate EFL learners in Lampung Province, Indonesia,
participated in the present study. Thirty two (18.5%) out of the 173 participants were male,
the rest (81.5%) were female. In addition, the participants were also almost at the same
age ranging from 17 – 23 years old, 19.39 years of age on average. They majored in
107

English Education (89.6%) and English Language and Literature (10.4%). They studied
EFL in public universities (51.4%) and private ones (48.6%).
The participants were also required to self-assess the level of their EFL proficiency
which was based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFRL). The Chart 1 below illustrates their perceived EFL proficiency.

The Chart 1 above illustrates the frequency and percentage of the participants who
self-assessed their EFL proficiency. It can be seen that most of the participants selfassessed themselves at Level A1 (37%), followed by Level B1 (25%), with a total of 64
and 43 participants respectively. Turning to the other levels, it can be clearly said that
Levels A2, B2, C1, and C2 have an almost similar pattern, with Level A2 having only 19
participants (11%), followed by Levels B2 and C2 with 17 participants (10%) and 16
participants (9%) respectively. Level C1 has the fewest frequency, with only 14 participants
(8%).
4.2

Instruments

The participants in this present study were asked to respond to three instruments: a
34-item online questionnaire for collecting data on the participants’ online informal
language learning activities and a 31-item online questionnaire for collecting data on
predominant language use when performing the online activities using their smartphone.
Both of them were developed by Jurkovič (2019) in which a few minor adjustments to the
Indonesian context were made. The last instrument was a self-assessment language
proficiency grid according to the CEFRL classified into three broad levels including Basic
User, Independent User, and Proficient User which can be broken down into six levels (A1C2) (COUNCIL OF EUROPE, 2001). This self-assessment, which was on a 1-6 scale
108

ranging from A1-C2, was used to see the participants’ perceived EFL proficiency.
4.3
Data analyses
The questionnaires were distributed online to the participants taking part in this
study. The 34-item online questionnaire was on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(never or almost never) to 5 (several times a day) in which the participants were classified
into two categories, frequent users (coded 3, 4, and 5) and infrequent users (coded 1 and
2) (JURKOVIČ, 2019). The 31-item online questionnaire was on a 1-3 scale (1 –
Indonesian, 2 – English, 3 – Indonesian and English). This questionnaire, which was used
to look at the language predominantly used for online informal learning activities using
smartphones, was quantitatively analyzed through descriptive statistics.
The data were also analyzed through the independent samples t-test to look at the
comparison between the mean value of the participants’ self-assessed EFL proficiency
and their predominant online language use (frequent and infrequent users of Indonesian
and English).

5 Findings
With regard to the participants’ most frequently-performed EFL learning activities
through smartphones (Research Question 1), their responses to the online questionnaire
for collecting data on their online informal EFL learning activities were computed as
presented in Table 1 below.

Table 1 above gives information that most of the participants (almost 100%)
frequently use their smartphones to do two productive and/or interactive online activities
which include writing short text messages (98.9%) and communicating with their
classmates (93.6%). Regarding the receptive online activities, these activities are shared
by more participants including looking for study-related information (96%), accessing
online dictionaries (94.1%), listening to music (92.4%), checking non-study related
information (91.3%), listening to lectures (89%), reading social media comments (87.3),
reading daily news and long texts (83.2%), watching short clips with text (82.7%), and
reading emails (75.1%). Overall, it is apparent that the receptive online activities using
smartphones are more common compared to the productive and/or interactive ones.
The other online activities the participants perform through their smartphones which
lie between 74% and 54.3% include using language learning applications (74%), watching
foreign films and television series with subtitles in English or another foreign language
(69.4%), writing down new words learned in a foreign language (65.8%), leaving voice
messages to other users (63%), reading e-books (62.4%), accessing websites with
language learning exercises (60.8%), watching television (59.6%), communicating with
teachers regarding study-related issues (59%), posting social media comments (54.3%),
and watching foreign films and television series with subtitles in first language (54.3%).
The other online activities which are done by less than half of the participants
include watching foreign films and television series with no subtitles (48%), playing games
that require reading instructions (46.8%), listening to podcasts (44.5%), writing emails
(42.8%), playing games that require written communication with other players (38.7%),

playing language games such as crosswords (37%), playing games that require spoken
communication with other players (37%), listening to audio books (35.3%), listening to the
radio (23.1%), keeping an audio/audio-visual blog (22.5%), and keeping a blog (16.2%)
which is the most infrequently-performed online activity by the participants under
investigation.
To address the Research Question 2 on the predominant language use for online
informal learning activities using smartphones, three categories of language use variables
were created. Value 1 refers to Indonesian, Value 2 to English, and Value 3 to both
Indonesian and English. Table 2 below shows data about the languages used by the
participants for their online activities through smartphones.

Table 2 shows language use and online activities using smartphones. It is clear that
the participants perform their informal learning activities online through their smartphones
in Indonesian, in English, and in combination of Indonesian and English. Looking firstly at
the activities predominantly performed in Indonesian, these activities include listening to
the radio (82.1%), watching television (75.7%), leaving voice messages to other users
(70.5%), writing emails (68.2%), communicating with classmates regarding study-related
issues (65.3%), keeping a blog (63%), reading the daily news (61.8%), keeping an
audio/audio-visual blog (56.6%), checking non-study related information (56.1%), listening
to podcasts (54.9%), and writing short text messages (54.3%).
Regarding the activities predominantly performed in English, more than half of the
participants listen to music in English (57.8%). Accessing online dictionaries, writing down
new words learned in a foreign language, and playing games that require reading
instructions are activities that are also performed in English by most of the participants,
56.6%, 53.8%, and 50.3% respectively.
The participants under study also reported that they listen to lectures in both
Indonesian and English. In other words, they sometimes perform it in Indonesian and on
some other occasions in English. However, it can be clearly seen that the other activities
are performed in either Indonesian, English, or Indonesian and English by less than half of
the participants, for example, listening to music is also performed in Indonesian, but by
only 2.3% of them. Writing short text messages is also performed in English, by 4% of
them and listening to the radio is performed both in Indonesian and English by 12.1% of
them.
To find out whether there is a statistically significant difference between the
participants’ perceived EFL proficiency and their online predominant language use
(Research Question 3), an inferential statistical test, the independent samples t-test, was
run. This test was used to find out the difference between the means of the participants’
perceived EFL proficiency obtained from two independent samples. Therefore, the test
was used to compare dichotomous variables, those who only predominantly use
Indonesian for their online informal learning activities and those who only predominantly
use English (see Table 3).

Table 3 gives information about the mean scores of the perceived EFL proficiency of
the participants who perform online informal learning activities in Indonesian against those
performing in English. In some online informal learning activities, the participants’
predominant language use for online informal learning activities, either Indonesian or
English, is closely related to the their perceived EFL proficiency. It can be clearly seen that
the CEFRL mean of those who oftetimes perform online informal learning activities in
English is statitistically and significantly higher than those performing in Indonesian (p >
0.05). The online activities include writing short text messages, reading emails, reading
social media comments, checking non-study related information, watching short clips with
text, reading the daily news, writing down new words learned in a foreign language,

playing games that requires reading instructions, accessing website with language
learning exercises, using language learning apps, reading e-books, leaving voice
messages to other users, listening to podcasts, and keeping an audio/audio-visual blog.
Regarding the other online activities through smartphones, it is apparent that the
CEFRL mean of those who perform online activities in English is higher than those in
Indonesian, with the exceptions of listening to the radio and keeping a blog, but it is not
statistically significant.

6 Discussion
This study focuses on the most frequently-performed online EFL learning activities
through smartphones, the predominant language used for the online activities by the
participants under investigation, and the difference between the means of the participants’
perceived EFL proficiency divided into two independent groups (those who perform online
informal learning activities in Indonesian and those in English).
Two productive and/or interactive online informal learning activities constitute nearly
100% of the participants under investigation. The two most frequently-performed
productive and/or interactive online activities by EFL learners in Indonesia are writing short
text messages and communicating with their classmates regarding study-related issues,
which is in line with Jurkovič's (2019) finding in the Slovenian context and with Sierocka,
Jurković, & Varga's (2019) finding in the context of Polish and Croatian students. Turning
to the receptive ones, the online informal learning activities most frequently performed by
the participants through their smartphones include looking for study-related information,
accessing online dictionaries, listening to music, checking non-study related information,
listening to lectures, reading social media comments, reading daily news and long texts,
watching short clips with text, and reading emails. In other words, the receptive online
activities using smartphones are more frequently performed compared to the productive
and/or interactive ones.
Regarding the predominant language use, the participants perform their online
activities through smartphones in Indonesian, which is the participants’ first language, in
English, and in both Indonesian and English, in which English is not the predominant
language used by the participants under investigation. This resonates with Putrawan and
Riadi’s (2020) finding. This indicates that although they can access their smartphone from
anywhere and at any time (ELAISH et al., 2017), they do not make use of their
smartphone to its full extent to improve their English linguistic competence as non-native
speakers of the language (ALI; MIRAZ, 2018) and to position themselves as true English
users, not only as learners of the language (SOCKETT; TOFFOLI, 2012). In other words,
the Internet-based activities through their smartphones are performed to not primarily learn
English even though they have a chance to develop their English language competence
(SOCKETT, 2014) and to get much exposure to authentic language input through their
smartphones (BAHRANI; SIM, 2012).
Finally, regarding the last research question on the difference of the mean scores of
the participants’ perceived EFL proficiency, it can be argued that their predominant
language use for online informal learning activities has to do with their perceived EFL
proficiency. The mean of the perceived EFL proficiency of those who frequently perfom
115

online informal learning activities through their smartphones in English is statistically and
significantly higher than those performing in Indonesian. This is in line with Jurkovič's
(2019) finding. Overall, although it is not statistically significant, the mean score of the
perceived EFL proficiency of those performing online activities in English is higher than
those in Indonesian, with the exceptions of listening to the radio and keeping a blog in
which the mean scores of their perceived EFL proficiency for these two activities are nearly
the same. This finding adds proof to other findings that language use plays an important
role in learners’ language development (BYBEE, 2010; ELLIS, RÖMER; O'DONNELL,
2016; LEE; DRESSMAN, 2018; SOCKETT; KUSYK, 2015 as cited in JURKOVIČ, 2019;
JURKOVIČ, 2019).

7 Conclusion
The findings of this present study explicitly indicate that receptive online informal
learning activities are performed more frequently by EFL learners in the context of
Indonesia compared to the productive and/or interactive activities in which Indonesian, the
first language, is predominantly used for the online activities through smartphones. In other
words, although the participants major in English Education and English Language and
Literature, however, English is not the predominant language used for their online activities
through smartphones. In addition, the mean score of the perceived EFL proficiency of
those who frequently perform online activities in English is statistically and significantly
higher than those performing online activities in Indonesian. Overall, the mean score of the
perceived EFL proficiency of those performing online activities in English is higher than
those in Indonesian, although the mean difference is not statistically significant.
This study has implications for EFL learning. Because language learning can derive
much benefit from mobile technology (KUKULSKA-HULME, 2015), integrating online
informal learning activities into formal educational contexts needs to be given
consideration (SOCKETT; TOFFOLI, 2012). Online learning activities can help learners
improve their certain aspects of English such as vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation,
reading (TRINDER, 2017; WANG; SMITH, 2013) and English speaking proficiency (LEE;
DRESSMAN, 2018). Social media such as Twitter and Facebook can also be integrated
into formal settings as a medium for learning (ROSELL-AGUILAR, 2018). Social media
can be fun online supplements to formal learning to help learners increase their awareness
to language learning opportunities in an effort to make them continuously learn
(ALADJEM; JOU, 2016), which then leads them to become an autonomous EFL learner
(NURHAENI; PURNAWARMAN, 2018).
However, this research is not without limitations. Although the findings in this
present study are able to provide fascinating insights into EFL learners’ most frequentlyperformed online activities through smartphones, their predominant online language use,
and the differences between their perceived EFL proficiency and their online language
use, this study was conducted in a medium-sized sample (n=173). Therefore, larger
number of samples should be taken into account to provide more reliable findings.
Conducting similar research with larger sample sizes in different contexts and settings
where English is a foreign language would also be useful to understand whether the
findings of the present study are globally applicable and acceptable.
