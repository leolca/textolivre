ABSTRACT: The present work aims to analyze the relationship of ICT with
neuroeducation, educational inclusion, environmental education and pluriculturality
through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (Structural Equation Model – SEM) of a created ad
hoc and a validated and confirmed scale. For the search for answers, a non-experimental,
descriptive, explanatory and correlational research process was carried out. The
instrument used to collect the data was a Likert scale, which has been validated in content
and with a good Cronbach's alpha (.825). The construct validity was carried out with an
exploratory factorial analysis (KMO (.764), Bartlett (Sign.000), Determinant (2.891E-30)).
The sample was of 292 students of Master’s Degree in Teacher Training from the
University of Jaen (Spain). The Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (SEM) allowed us to
conclude that this relationship is possible, with greater strength between education
technologies and educational inclusion, and between the former and pluriculturality, and
with less strength between environmental education and neuroeducation, what should be
taken into account to implement in university training programs.
KEYWORDS: ICT. Neuroeducation. Educational inclusion. Environmental education.

RESUMO: O presente trabalho tem como objetivo analisar a relação das TIC com a
neuroeducação, inclusão educacional, educação ambiental e pluriculturalidade através da
Análise Fatorial Confirmatória (Structural Equation Model – SEM) de uma escala, criada
ad hoc, validada e confirmada. Para a busca de respostas, foi realizado um processo de
pesquisa não-experimental, descritivo, explicativo e correlacional. O instrumento utilizado
para a coleta dos dados foi uma escala Likert, que foi validada em conteúdo e com um
bom alfa do Cronbach (.825). A validade da construção foi realizada com uma análise
fatorial exploratória (KMO (.764), Bartlett (Sign.000), Determinante (2.891E-30)). A
amostra foi de 292 alunos de pós-graduação da Universidade de Jaén (Espanha). A
análise fatorial confirmatória (modelo de equação estrutural) nos permitiu concluir que
essa relação é possível, com maior força entre as tecnologias educacionais e a inclusão
educacional, e entre a primeira e a pluriculturalidade, e com menor força entre educação
ambiental e neuroeducação, o que deve ser levado em conta para implementar em
programas de treinamento universitário.

1 Introduction
At the university level, students who study “education” have curricular subjects of
different types and content. Thus, in the Spanish curricula, undergraduate students study
ICT, inclusive education and environmental education; however, until now, in the year
2020, we do not find subjects that deal specifically with neuroeducation and pluriculturality.
In the students who are studying the official master's degree in teacher training, whose
objective is to be teachers in secondary education, we do not find subjects specifically
dealing with ICT, neuroeducation, educational inclusion, environmental education or
pluriculturality. This student, on the other hand, has a very diverse origin (architecture,
engineering, medicine...), so we can safely say that in their respective undergraduate
studies they have not fully studied the areas that are the subject of study here. It is for this
reason that we take this group as a study population, as we will try to establish whether
there is a relationship between these areas, and see the implications that this relationship
has for incorporating them into university studies.
In postgraduate training, a master's degree has appeared in recent years aimed at
establishing the professionalization of secondary and language teachers: the University
Master's Degree in Compulsory Secondary Education, Baccalaureate, Vocational Training
and Language Teaching which has replaced the old Pedagogical Adaptation Course (PAC,
1-10-09), which is compulsory for anyone who wants to enter this profession. The design
of the course is established by the Ministry of Education, although it is subject to
modification depending on the Autonomous Community and the University (BUENDÍA et
al., 2011). The new legislations, as well as the emerging social demands, require different
types of approaches for the learning of secondary school teachers, guided by rigour,
cultural, psycho-pedagogical and didactic training. The most important aim of this master's
degree is for student to acquire the necessary skills to exercise the teaching profession.
Some of the fundamental challenges in the training of secondary teachers are: training in
new functions, pedagogical reformulation of training, the relationship between theory and
practice, the low level of teacher professionalization, training in ICTs, lax rules of access to
training, and the procedure for incorporation into the teaching profession (TERIGI, 2009,
cited in GUTIÉRREZ et al., 2019). Linked to these new requirements is school failure,
understood here as not graduating from secondary education, which is a serious problem
that must be taken into consideration in order to improve national education systems. This
phenomenon is considered to be learning difficulties that can lead to student failure
(ESCUDERO, 2012). The factors related to school dropout are diverse, mostly related to
social, economic, educational, family and personal contexts (HERNÁNDEZ et al., 2018).
Some knowledge has become very relevant for the training of future education
professionals, especially in the stages of primary and secondary education. That is why we
propose this research, because we not only think it is important to study and train in
neuroeducation or pluriculturality, but also to analyze whether ICT contribute to inclusion or
pluriculturality, or whether neuroeducation has an influence on ICT etc. Before presenting
the research to be carried out, we are going to provide some references on each research
topic, in order to have a common and current idea of each one of them.
In Spain, one of the most important points of the School 2.0 plan is that which refers
to the training of teachers in ICT (SUÁREZ et al., 2013). Information and communication
technologies have burst into teaching practices, becoming a mediating agent in the
teaching and learning processes (ERTMER; OTTENBREIF; LEFTWICH, 2010), in
263

Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 3, p. 262-277, set.-dez. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.35699/1983-3652.2020.25739

addition, we find numerous studies on the need for changes in the traditional concept
taught in schools, so Gil and Fernandez (2020) tell us about the importance of Instagram,
the value of ICT in different disabilities, such as autism (ALMEIDA et al., 2020), the Projeto
Novos Rumos 4.0 (SGORLA; COSTA; ZAVILENSKY, 2020).
In relation to inclusion, the world's education systems face the challenge of
providing quality education to children and young people. In the face of these demands
there is undoubtedly interest in the idea of inclusive education, however, this term still
remains confusing (ECHEITA; AINSCOW, 2011). Educational inclusion is a form of
response and attention to the diversity of the syllabuses in the educational context, with a
broad projection of equal educational opportunities and all within an environment that
promotes the integral, personal and academic development of all students (LEHOHLA;
HLALELE, 2012). Analyzing other studies, González, Martín Pastor and Orgaz (2017)
appear who carried out a questionnaire oriented to the evaluation of the initial formation in
inclusive education of university students of the education degrees. The environmental
education would enter to form part of these knowledges, let us call them "essential" for the
education of the 21st century. Environmental education appears as a proposal for social
action that seeks to mitigate natural disasters and to educate individuals so that they can
understand the environment in which they live and understand their capacity to act in the
face of natural disasters. (ORDONEZ-DIAZ; MONTES-ARIAS; GARZON-CORTES, 2018)
Some previous studies can be found in the scientific literature that have already assessed
the effectiveness of scales on environmental education, such as the Scale for the
Assessment of Pro-environmental Attitudes (EAPA) of university students (CASTAÑEDO,
1995).
Related to all of the above, we undoubtedly have the cultural diversity
(pluriculturality), which as a consequence of migratory movements produced in the last
decades, the population masses have experienced deep social changes, both in Europe
and more specifically in the case of Spain. Pluricultural diversity has become a
considerable factor within social policies, as well as research that places it as an object of
study in higher education, where we did not have current jobs (ALGARRA, 2020).
However, despite the fact that this diversity appears under different focuses (gender
differences, social and ethnic classes etc.), it has been the arrival of foreign emigration
that has led to the adoption of legislative measures and pedagogical modifications in order
to adapt to this new social panorama. Peñalva and Soriano (2010), show how the
presence of interculturality as an obligatory content is very insignificant within initial
training, in this case of future educators and teachers. This inevitably leads us to think that
in the other grades, especially those not related to the humanistic and social, the
contributions to culturality will be nil.
Another concept that has emerged in recent years in all countries is that of
neuroeducation, within the most recent teaching methods currently appears immersed in
this new science, which is understood as a new line of thought and action whose primary
objective is to bring educators closer to knowledge related to the brain and learning, in an
attempt to unite Pedagogy, Cognitive Psychology and Neurosciences (CAMPOS, 2010), in
addition to establishing the basis for an optimal teaching and learning process (LUQUE;
LUCAS, 2020).
In relation to all this, and referring to the population of study, one of the most
relevant characteristics of the master's degree in teacher training, and that we pointed out
before, is the diversity of academic itineraries with which the population of study accesses
264

Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 3, p. 262-277, set.-dez. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.35699/1983-3652.2020.25739

and that finally guides them to exercise as teachers of Secondary Education. Different
studies alert us to the lack of complete pedagogical training in the University Master's
Degree in Compulsory Secondary Education, Baccalaureate, Vocational Training and
Language Teaching, making it necessary to develop more competencies related to
pedagogical, communication, empathy and cooperative work skills, etc. (MANSO AYUSO;
MARTÍN, 2014). In this way, as it can be appreciated along all the exposed, there are
investigations for each one of the dimensions studied in this investigation, nevertheless,
there are not found in the literature studies that in a conjunctive way include the
dimensions that are proposed here, for the students of Master´s Degree in Teacher
Training.

2 Method
This research is based on the following general objective: to analyze the
relationship between ICT, neuroeducation, educational inclusion, environmental education
and pluriculturality, in higher education. The research design is non-experimental,
descriptive, explanatory and correlational, quantitative methodology and we take as
reference an interpretative paradigm. In order to carry out the research, a Likert scale is
used as a research instrument.
The population that can be investigated is made up of the students of the Master's
Degree in Teacher Training at an Andalusian university. This population is made up of 300
subjects. We will take the whole population, so the sample coincides with the population.
The Likert scale, after several absences and dropouts, was finally answered by 292
subjects.
The dimensions of this study, extracted from the theoretical framework and the
construction of the Likert scale are A.-Environmental education, B.-Educational
technologies, C.-Pluriculturality, D.-Educational inclusion and E.-Neuroeducation.
Consequently, we establish as independent variables: environmental education,
educational technologies, pluriculturality, educational inclusion and neuroeducation. The
dependent variables are: knowledge, perception. As an instrument we opted for a Likert
scale, which was constructed with an operationalization table. Five dimensions are
established, with a total of sixty-two items. The content validation was done with an expert
judgment and pilot test, secondly, a factorial analysis was done to validate the scale in its
construction using SPSS v25 software. The reliability analysis was performed by
calculating Cronbach's alpha, giving a score of .825, which is considered good (GEORGE;
MALLERY, 2003). Lisrel 8.80 was used for the structural modeling.

3 Results
The validity of the content was carried out by fifteen specialist doctors (MALLA;
ZABALA, 1978) authorised to carry out this evaluation and belonging to different
universities. Their competence coefficient was calculated as k=0.9, which shows a high
level of competence (GARCÍA; FERNÁNDEZ (2008), LÓPEZ (2008); MENGUAL (2011)).
After analyzing the validation questionnaires, some questions were readjusted, without
265

Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 3, p. 262-277, set.-dez. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.35699/1983-3652.2020.25739

affecting the substance of the question. On the other hand, a pilot test was carried out on a
subgroup of the sample to review comprehension difficulties, identify questions that
generated doubt, etc., using the corresponding checklist (IRAOSSI, 2006). The results of
the pilot test were satisfactory and the instrument was considered validated in its content.
The validity of the construct was carried out through exploratory factor analysis. The
factorial analysis technique we have applied follows the guidelines set out in the following
stages (GARCÍA FERRANDO, 2015; DÍAZ DE RADA, 2002):
1.-Study of the correlation matrix: it is necessary to study the correlation matrix to
check if our data are suitable to carry out a Factorial Analysis. To do this, this matrix must
have a certain structure. To check this, we have used the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of
sampling adequacy (KMO coefficient), in our case the value is 0.764, following Kaiser
(1974) the value is acceptable, the result of Bartlett's sphericity test is .000 and the
determinant 2.891E-30, so we continue with the analysis.
2.-Extraction of the factors: once it was decided that the factorial analysis can give
good results, the extraction of the factors is carried out. In a good extraction these values
should be high (the closer to one the better) in all variables. The resulting of communalities
showed us that the factors have a value greater than 0.606 so it is not necessary to
eliminate any item from the factor analysis. The best represented items are: B17 (.845)
The use of ICT in school settings facilitates coordination, communication and cooperation
among teachers. C30 (,852) - It is relevant to introduce cultural studies in the current
school in order to achieve a more just and equal future society. D35 (.847) The concepts of
integration and inclusion in schools are of the same nature. D38 (,859) Pupils should
receive assistance according to their needs outside the ordinary classroom. D48 (,867) It
seems more appropriate to speak of disability rather than functional diversity, as this term
is more explicit. E51 (849) Knowledge of neurosciences allows us to better understand the
situation of persons with functional diversity. The worst represented items are: A01 (,626).Environmental education is a training process that allows awareness of the importance of
the environment. C22 (,682) - The term multicultural refers to the current of thought that
studies the presence of heterogeneous cultures in the same space and time. D39 (,693)
Equity among people is the underlying value of inclusion.
3-Rotation of the factors: To carry out the rotations there are several methods
according to the criterion of optimality. One of them is the Varimax Rotation that optimizes
the factorial loads so that the most extreme loads are obtained in the factors (high and
low). There are rules to know the most adequate number of factors to conserve, for
example, the one known as Kaiser's criterion (1974) that indicates that it is necessary to
conserve the main components whose own values are greater than the unit, although the
most used criterion is that of observing the percentage of total variance explained by each
component or factor, and when this reaches an accumulated percentage considered high,
in our case they are the first 18 factors, which explain 77,789 of the accumulated variance
(Table 1).

We have calculated Cronbach's alpha of both factors: Factor 1: ,935 (38 items),
"excellent" rating. Factor 2: ,779 (11 items), rating "acceptable". We took the factor 1,
which presents a higher reliability than the original scale itself, getting a final scale of 38
items, reducing 24 items.

Correlation analysis

To carry out the correlation, we subjected the Likert scale to the KolmogorovSmirnov test, which explains that the data do not follow a normal distribution, so the
Spearman correlation has to be used. Next in Table 3 we show the correlations between
items that have significant value (0.05):

E51<>E52, E50>E51 and finally E62>E58. In other words, people who think that
environmental education should deal with the subject of environmental crisis also think that
it should deal with sustainable development. Similarly, the subjects interviewed agree that
knowledge about neurosciences allows us to better understand the situation of people with
functional diversity, as well as to adapt our pedagogy to the natural ways of learning of the
students. Also, the people who say that currently the knowledge about neurosciences is
useful in the teaching practice, correlates significantly that allow us to better understand
the situation of people with functional diversity. Finally, the subjects who agree that training
in neurosciences allows us to better understand what knowledge is the most appropriate
depending on the maturity stage in which the person is, state that learning based on
neurosciences is known as "neuroeducation".

Confirmatory Factorial Analysis

The SEM methodology, which we will carry out with the Lisrel 8.80 software,
consists of a series of phases according to Kaplan (2000) and Kline (2005) that we will
specify in four.
Phase I.-Specification of the Measurement Model
At this stage, the latent features and the dimensions that represent them are
established as variables of interest in a substantive theory. This stage is of a conceptual
nature and it formulates the structure of relationships between the latent variables
represented by the dimensions of the instrument and the responses to the context
questionnaire. The Conceptual Model of the Likert scale obtained from the exploratory
factor analysis is composed of 38 observed variables that are grouped into five
dimensions. For the structural study we will use the factorial scale with 38 observed
variables.

Phase II - Identification. Computational Implementation of the System of Structural
Equations.
To determine if the model is identified we must calculate the degrees of freedom
(gl), in our case the value is 518, so we can say that the model is over-identified.
Phase III - Parameter estimation
The model estimation phase (Figure 1) includes a graphic representation of the
theoretical-conceptual structure of the instrument under analysis. This representation is
the basis for the formulation of the reproduced matrix that will be compared with the
derived matrix. For the Likert scale the graphic representation is shown in the figure, in
which the ovals represent the five latent variables (constructs) and the boxes the 38
variables observed, which together make up the dimensionality of the instrument.

We reviewed the regression coefficients between the latent and observed variables,
the interpretation being as follows.
Dimension A (Environmental education): -More influence of the latent variable on:
A05.-In environmental education the subject of environmental crisis should be dealt with. Less influence of the latent variable on: A01.-Environmental education is a training process
that allows awareness of the importance of the environment.
Dimension B (Educational technologies):-More influence of the latent variable on:
B16.-Adequate implementation of New Information and Communication Technologies in
the school facilitates communication between family and school -Lesser influence of the

latent variable on: B15.-The use of New Technologies facilitates access to new sources of
information, surpassing in this aspect traditional methodologies.
Dimension C (Pluriculturality): -More influence of the latent variable on: C23.Interculturality is the interaction between two or more cultures equally, favoring the
inclusion and harmonious coexistence of all individuals from a respectful relationship
between cultures. -Lesser influence of the latent variable on: C22.-The term multicultural
refers to the current of thought that studies the presence of heterogeneous cultures in the
same space and time.
Dimension D (Educational inclusion): -More influence of the latent variable on: D42.Educational inclusion is the process of analysis by which an attempt is made to eliminate
barriers of various kinds that limit the presence, learning and participation of students in
school life, especially the most vulnerable. -Lesser influence of the latent variable on:
D45.-Accessibility is related to school inclusion.
Dimension E (Neuroeducation): -More influence of the latent variable on: E52.-The
knowledge of neurosciences allows us to adapt our pedagogy to the natural ways of
learning of the students. -Lesser influence of the latent variable on: E52: E54.-Facilitate
synaptic connections have a direct impact on learning.

B (Educational technologies)-D (Educational inclusion) (.91)
B (Educational technologies)-C (Pluriculturality) (.84)
The lowest ratio is given by:
A (Environmental education)-E (Neuroeducation) (.33)
Phase IV - Evaluation of the adjustment Application of indexes and criteria of
goodness of fit.
At this stage we use indices (Table 4) and goodness-of-fit criteria to relate the
validated evidence to the dimensional structure of the instrument being evaluated:

4 Discussion and conclusions
The present research has as general objective to analyze the relationship of ICT
with neuroeducation, educational inclusion, environmental education and pluriculturality
through the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (SEM) of a scale, created ad hoc. The scale
presents a very good content validity, an excellent reliability, and through the exploratory
factorial analysis a construct validity that allows us to have a really excellent instrument,
besides, the confirmatory analysis validates the model of interrelations between the
investigated topics. The main limitation of this study is determined by the selected sample,
only students of a master's degree from a Spanish university. In the near future we want to
extend this sample and eliminate this limitation. From the exploratory factorial analysis, we
can contribute some interesting conclusions, among them that, although we have new
terms, it seems more appropriate to continue talking about disability, as well as the
importance of including cultural or neuroscience studies in teacher training. It is not
relevant, although it is worrying, the little importance given to environmental education, or
to equity in inclusion. From the correlation analysis, some hopeful conclusions arise, so
that environmental education is correlated with sustainable development, which
neuroscience gives a scientific basis to the teacher's performance. Finally, the most
remarkable conclusions that give sense to this research are provided by the Confirmatory
Factorial Analysis (SEM), showing that in environmental education the most important
concept is the environmental crisis, in educational technologies it is the one that facilitates
the relationship between family and school, in pluriculturality that the interaction of cultures
favors inclusion, eliminating barriers of all kinds, and finally that knowledge in
neurosciences is applicable in the classroom, so we conclude by saying that the strongest
relationship is given by "technologies" with "educational inclusion", and "pluriculturality",
while the lowest relationship is between environmental education and neuroeducation. In
other words, we should reflect that not only should we introduce new and very current

subjects in the undergraduate or graduate programs, but we should also study the
relationships that these "new" subjects present to see how they support each other, or on
the contrary, they have no affinity. In this way, studying technologies will facilitate a better
understanding of educational inclusion and pluriculturality, while no matter how much we
teach environmental education or neuroeducation we will not obtain affinity between them.
