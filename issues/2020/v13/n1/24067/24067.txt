ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a corpus-based examination of the discourse of
eliteness and personalisation news values in the information source. To that end, the study
compares digital news in British and Spanish corpora. The results reveal a tendency to
quote elites, which are frequently constructed by means of recognised names from politics,
inanimate references with broad scope and role labels in apposition. To a lesser extent,
prestige is construed through status-indicating modifiers and allusion to place of work.
Ordinary sources, however, are usually construed via indication of provenance, reference
to family relationship and anaphoric allusions, mostly in British sources. It remains to be
clarified whether the construal of these values is in consonance with the editorial stance of
the newspaper.
KEYWORDS: discourse; eliteness; information source; news values; personalisation.
RESUMO: Este artigo propõe um exame, baseado em corpus, do discurso da elite e a
personalização dos valores informacionais na fonte de informação. Para isso, o estudo
compara as notícias digitais em corpora britânicos e espanhóis. Os resultados revelam
uma tendência a citar as elites, que são frequentemente construídas através de nomes
políticos reconhecidos, referências inanimadas de grande alcance e etiquetas de papel na
aposição. Em menor medida, o prestígio é interpretado através de modificadores que
indicam status e alusões ao lugar de trabalho. As fontes comuns, no entanto, são
geralmente interpretadas através da indicação de proveniência, referência à relação
familiar e alusões anafóricas, especialmente em fontes britânicas. Resta esclarecer se a
interpretação destes valores está em consonância com a postura editorial do jornal.
PALAVRAS-CHAVE: discurso; elitismo; fonte de informação; valores informacionais;
personalização.
1 Introduction
Newsgathering has traditionally been claimed to be more of an art than a science.
The selection of news content that may satisfy the audience corresponds to the instincts of
news editors, who are said to need a ‘nose’ for predicting the newsworthy value of a piece
of news (BOYD, 2001; SERGEANT, 2001). However, having the individual ability to predict
newsworthiness is not sufficient to produce news items, the selection is rather exercised
within the constraints of the media outlets within which journalists operate (HARRISON,
1

2006, p. 13).
News reporters do not just act as gatekeepers, i.e. decision-makers accountable for
the selection of events from the array of information available, they also have to cope with
the market. Although the media institutions are expected to meet the needs of society,
editorial priorities usually comply with commercial purposes (ALLERN, 2011; CAPLE,
2018). Thus, journalists in the newsroom do not just consider “the fresh, unpublished,
unusual and generally interesting” (RANDALL, 2000, p. 23) when selecting information for
publication, they also aim to conform to the prevailing economic norms.
Reporters, in particular those publishing online, must also be able to address time
constraints. According to De Nies et al., “the consumer needs for near-immediate reporting
significantly limits the time for journalists to select and produce content”, which together
with the vast amount of information readers have at their quick disposal, hamper the
management of an event in terms of its alleged newsworthiness (2012, p. 106).
Framing news stories as interestingly as possible also belongs to media reporters
(GUO, 2012, p. 27). The portrayal of an event necessarily involves that some details
surrounding it must be disregarded. This fact could be detrimental to readers, as they have
little control over the details that have not been included, nor do they have access to the
original source of information to assess the validity of the report (REAH, 2001, p. 5). As a
matter of fact, “people who have been involved in newsworthy events that have been
ignored or misrepresented by the newspapers often find themselves wondering what else
may be excluded from coverage, or presented in a misleading way” (2001, p. 5).
Nevertheless, the exclusion of elements does not always imply negative intent, on many
occasions newspapers focus on certain aspects of an event without any ulterior motive
(STAAB, 1990, p. 439).
On the basis of the assumption that subjectivity is innate in language and that a
certain bias is always going to be present in journalistic discourse, both in news selection
and construction (FOWLER, 1994; BLANCO-GÓMEZ, 2004), the present paper analyses
eliteness and personalisation news values, with an emphasis on the way they are
constructed in the discourse. In order to assess newsworthiness in digital storytelling, an
in-depth study of information sources is carried out. The corpus-based study analyses
digital news published in British and Spanish quality papers and is organised as follows:
section 2 discusses literature on the conceptualisation of newsworthiness by focusing on
Bednarek and Caple’s approach (2017). Section 3 continues analysing reported speech
and the construction of news values, in particular eliteness and personalisation. Section 4
explains and justifies the methodology employed in the corpora. Both quantitative and
qualitative results are presented in section 5. Finally, section 6 is devoted to the
conclusions and suggests some lines for further research in the field. Due to the relatively
small size of information sources analysed, the value of the results is limited with regard to
these news judgements, though the researcher launches some preliminary findings in the
paper as a prelude to having more consistent results.

2 Conceptual distinctions
News values, or the set of factors that confers newsworthiness to the stories, have
been one of the key areas of enquiry in critical discourse analysis and media linguistics. In
2

journalism-related research, they are said to play a core role in the news process. As
Shoemaker (2006) indicates, newsworthiness is a cognitive construct or mental judgement
that comprises a wide range of factors that influence what becomes news, as well as the
prominence of the events covered. It thus appears indisputable that news values “drive the
way news stories are gathered, structured and presented”, having great influence over the
selection and presentation of news events and thus constituting one of the primary
functions of copy editors (BELL, 2001, p. 76, 247).
However, there has been wide debate regarding their definition and measurement,
resulting in the treatment of the term ‘news values’ as a misleading concept (O’NEILL;
HARCUP, 2009; BEDNAREK, 2016). News values can be approached through different
perspectives, but even under the same scope, research studies do not assess these
qualities in an equal way, nor do they use the same terminology to refer to them. According
to Bednarek and Caple, news values can be defined from four distinct dimensions, as
follows:
An event and its material reality holds potential news value for a given community
(material); that news workers and audience members have beliefs about news
values and newsworthiness (cognitive); that news values are applied as selection
criteria in journalistic practice (social), and that news values can be communicated
through discourse (discursive) (2017, p. 42).

The material perspective presupposes news values as intrinsic to news events
since it alludes to the ‘potentiality’ of newsworthy factors. This approach has been recently
criticised, as the news values that are constructed in a text do not need to be intrinsic to
the corresponding news event (BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017).
In the case of the cognitive dimension, it refers to the news qualities that reporters
and/or the audience confer on a story, which may, in turn, determine the selection and
subsequent publication of the event (social dimension). The cognitive stage is often
exerted unconsciously by newsworkers and comprises predicting decisions about the
supposed preferences of the target audience (BELL, 2001, p. 155; RICHARDSON, 2007,
p. 94). According to Van Dijk, the mere term ‘value’ implies the placement of news values
in social cognition, and so these properties appear to set the cognitive basis concerning
the selection, focus, processing and representation of news items (1988, p. 119).
Following the cognitive view, news reporters select an event depending on their
judgements upon its inherent newsworthy value(s) and consequently, “the more of these
news values are satisfied, the more likely an event will be selected” (DE NIES et al., 2012,
p. 107). Nevertheless, the cognitive dimension frequently conflates with the other aspects
(material, social and discourse), and so a more comprehensive position is needed to
assess the intricacy of newsworthiness.
Finally, the discursive perspective entails the way news values are constructed
through discourse, the target of the present investigation. Once an event has been chosen
to be reported in the press, it needs to be moulded in as newsworthy a way as possible.
The devices used to construct newsworthiness are usually conventionalised as a
consequence of the journalistic practice carried out through time, some of them being
labelled as ‘journalistic clichés’ (LOZADA, 2014; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017).
Concerning the written press, the discursive stage is articulated through the
3

dimension of space, i.e. the general layout of the newspaper article, together with the
linguistic units that configure the news events (COTTER, 2010, p. 75). The visual
component may be noticeable in both print media and online newspapers, though visuals
are more important in the online environment. Online newspapers frequently ‘play’ with
space in that they organise their home page and the news articles within the journal
depending on the presence (or absence) of news values. However, the study of visuals
goes beyond the present study.
Apart from the above-explained dimensions through which news values can be
approached, there are many other factors that may influence the selection of events as
news, such as deadlines, commercial imperatives, economic constraints, and cultural and
political considerations (O’NEILL; HARCUP, 2009; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017). These
factors are context-sensitive, as they can change over time and be affected by the place of
publication, not to mention the influence exerted by the audience and the newspaper’s
policy (O’NEILL; HARCUP, 2009; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017). However, in most scholarly
publications these aspects are not considered, defined or labelled as news values
(BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017).
In conclusion, news values, or the set of categories that confers newsworthiness to
news stories, do not only have a gatekeeping role in the selection of events, but they also
incarnate wide-ranging factors that affect the newsworthy quality of the information.
Consequently, following an interdisciplinary approach is always at play when approaching
these values.

3 News values and the information source
Walter Lippmann (1922) was the pioneer in the study of news values suggesting the
existence of certain principles or qualities that are decisive in the selection of news.
However, it is actually the seminal work by Galtung and Ruge (1965) that is regarded as
the foundational study of these values. Since then, several researchers in the field have
proposed various taxonomies, such as Van Dijk (1988), Bell (2001) or O’Neill and Harcup
(2009), to mention but a few. Although there is a core of news values that is recognised by
most scholars, few investigations have focused on specific news values that may be
constructed in the information source.
The present paper presents an investigation of the discourse of news values in the
British and Spanish digital media focused on the information source construal. To that end,
a brief revision of the different modes of speech representation, as well as the main
components present in the citation segment, should first be laid out.
There are two traditional ways of presenting speech that involve semantic
differences, namely direct and indirect speech. The former claims to be a verbatim
reproduction of a previous statement, whereas indirect speech purports to paraphrase the
original utterance. When the speakers/writers paraphrase information, they need to shift all
deictic elements and extra-linguistic referents away from direct reference to the speech
situation (LEECH; SHORT, 2007, p. 255-256). For instance, (1) “I will pay it next week”,
Mary told me yesterday vs. (2) Mary told me yesterday that she would pay the electricity
bill the following week. In both speech modes, speakers/writers intervene as interpreters of
4

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 1, p. 1-19, jan.-abr. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

the original source of information and the word(s) previously said, thus constructing the
evidence in the form of a report.
There are many other stylistic variants of speech representation allowing for greater
interference or distance from the quoted information, such as free direct speech or the
mixed mode (KUO, 2007; LEECH; SHORT, 2007). The use of a mixed reporting style is
very common in the press, where the original speaker’s words are embedded, both
grammatically and semantically, within the reporter’s own discourse (VIS, 2011), as in (3)
Mary told me yesterday that she would pay the electricity bill the following week as she
was “going through a hard time”. This reporting style allows “the maximum effectiveness
and vividness in the shortest space possible” (SEMINO, 2009), even distance and
responsibility’s mitigation from the words of the original speaker.
In the citation or reporting segment, some elements are frequently present. For
instance, the source of information (‘Mary’), i.e. the original author of the utterance, or the
reporting verb (‘said’). Sometimes the reporting marker can be a different part of speech,
such as an adverb (‘allegedly’) or a prepositional phrase (‘according to’). Other elements
can be included in the reporting segment, for instance the addressee of the assertion
made by the information source (‘me’), or information about the context within which the
quoted evidence was provided, for example the date (‘yesterday’).
Having briefly clarified the main reporting styles and the common elements present
in the citation segment, a comprehensive analysis of the sort of news values that are
usually construed in the source of information will follow, specifically eliteness and
personalisation. These news values configure themselves as the most common options
used by journalists when constructing information sources in terms of newsworthiness, as
their description is generally positioned towards the elite or the human face of the news
actor(s).
3.1

Eliteness

The selection of the source of information depends on journalistic judgements of
what constitutes news, generally governed by the news value of ‘eliteness’ (KISUKE,
2004; HJARVARD, 2012). The news selection criteria of eliteness has received distinct
terminology in academic research, such as ‘prominence’, ‘eminence’, ‘importance’, ‘worth’,
‘status’, ‘personalities’, ‘attribution’, ‘celebrity’ or ‘power’ (BELL, 2001; MASTERTON, 2005;
BRIGHTON; FOY, 2007; MONTGOMERY, 2007, among others). According to Bednarek
and Caple (2017), eliteness relates to either human or non-human entities and may
incorporate various kinds of ‘eliteness’ that can be construed in the discourse, such as
“status, expertise, authority, celebrity, fame, or stardom” (2017, p. 58). To be more specific,
this news value may comprise countries, nations, institutions, organisations, events and
happenings of high status, and various kinds of people, such as celebrities, politicians or
religious leaders, inter alia (2017, p. 58). The prominence status of the elite is scalar, since
it depends on the target audience as well as the basis of its recognition, whether local,
national or international (2017, p. 58).
In the case of elite people, they are commonly used as “objects for general
identification”, preventing ordinary people from the possibility of representing themselves
in the news media (GALTUNG; RUGE, 1965, p. 68). Those who are not the elite are
normally contacted by the press to supply information based on drama or conflict value; for
5

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 1, p. 1-19, jan.-abr. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

instance, when they are a victim of a crime or a survivor of a disaster (BELL, 2001;
KISUKE, 2004; MASTERTON, 2005). As Lampropoulou indicates, the media favours the
use of ‘official’ sources, relegating ordinary people to the presentation of their experiences
and reactions to news rather than their opinions (2014, p. 473). Hence, it seems that high
status people would legitimate the actions and thoughts of the other segment of society
through their (selected) discourse.
One explanation for the prominence of the powerful in the press is the lack of
personnel and budgetary constraints, i.e. availability. As a result, journalists are compelled
to use institutional rather than private sources of information (ALLERN, 2011, p. 144).
According to Gans,
Reporters who have only a short time to gather information must [...] attempt to
obtain the most suitable news from the fewest number of sources as quickly and
easily as possible, and with the least strain on the organization’s budget (1979, p.
128).

Therefore, time constraints and a search of suitability are the causes that might
force journalists to resort to the elite. By overusing powerful sources, news reporters
emphasise the dissemination of conventional opinions held by the established authority,
reinforcing a male-dominated newsroom (CURRAN; SEATON, 2003; MAÑOSOPACHECO, 2018).
Regarding the devices identified in the construction of this news value, Bednarek
and Caple acknowledge the following grammatical and lexical resources:
Various status markers, including role labels (Professor Roger Stone, experts);
status-indicating adjectives (the prestigious Man Booker prize, top diplomats);
recognized names (Hillary Clinton); descriptions of achievement/fame (were selling
millions of records a year); use by news actors/sources of specialized/technical
terminology, high-status accent or sociolect (esp. in broadcast news) (2017, p. 79,
italics in the original).

As Mañoso-Pacheco states, all these resources are mainly aimed at portraying the
information source as a “competent person based on the idea of authority and prestige”
(2017, p. 145). In the case of role labels, there are normally titles or quasi-titles that appear
in appositional noun phrases with determiner deletion (e.g. ‘Peter Carter, general secretary
of the Royal College of Nursing’) or in predication (e.g. ‘a Palestinian Christian who is a
senior official in the Palestine Liberation Organisation’). According to Bell, the construction
of apposition with determiner deletion elevates the name of the source to equal status with
its description, as if it were a pseudo-title, such as ‘President’ or ‘professor’, presenting the
news actor as newsworthy (2011, p. 181).
Although sometimes the reporting segment includes the proper name of the
sources, these commonly remain anonymous in the description, as in ‘experts’ or ‘officials’
(BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017, p. 82). Unknown references to sources have been largely
discussed in the literature receiving various labels, such as ‘mythical groups of reference’
or ‘unspecified collective sources’ (MENZ, 1989; STENVALL, 2008; MAÑOSO-PACHECO,
2017). It is the “aura of secrecy” surrounding the configuration of these sources what
makes them construct (and embody) eliteness news value (STENVALL, 2008, p. 233).

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

The elite status of sources may also be boosted by means of superlative adjectives
in pre-modifying position, such as ‘top’ or ‘prestigious’ (BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017, p. 82).
Moreover, proper nouns referring to entities recognisable to the target audience and
occupying a high-status position may also construe eliteness news value (2017, p. 83), for
instance, ‘Barack Obama’.
As Bednarek and Caple claim, the range of resources that may construct eliteness
news value is not a closed list and its elements can be combined. Hence, analysts may
encounter many other linguistic devices.
3.2

Personalisation

The information source can also construct the news value of ‘personalisation’. This
newsworthy factor has been treated as synonymous with other terms and expressions
such as ‘reference to persons’, ‘personalities’, ‘familiarity’ or ‘personification’ (GALTUNG;
RUGE, 1965; BELL, 2001). According to Bednarek and Caple, this news value is about
“giving a ‘human’ face to the news through references to ‘ordinary’ people, their emotions,
views, and experiences – rather than focusing on abstract issues and processes” (2017, p.
61). Ordinary people are frequently defined as ‘non-elite individuals’, since they do not act
or speak in an official capacity (2017, p. 62). As Galtung and Ruge indicate, “the more the
event can be seen in personal terms, as due to the action of specific individuals, the more
probable that it will become a news item” (1965, p. 68). However, in the present paper, this
news value does not apply to actions performed by individuals in general or quotes coming
from them, but the portrayal of personalisation in the reporting segment by showing the
human or personal face of the information source.
This news value is quite remarkable in the case of reported speech, where the
quoted information needs to be linked to the original source of the assertion, usually a
human being, to be presented objectively (HARCUP; O’ NEILL, 2001, p. 273). The reason
why journalists would prefer constructing the source as an ordinary agent may be due to
their attempt to boost readers’ identification. Ordinary sources of information easily serve
as objects of general identification by means of projection and empathy (GALTUNG;
RUGE, 1965, p. 69). Therefore, readers appear to identify more readily when facts are
reported by a source of information who is ‘like them’, rather than elites, even if the quoted
facts are processes or abstract issues (BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017, p. 90).
The selection of ordinary sources of information facilitates low processing effort of
the reported information, in that personalisation value contributes to reduce “complex
processes and institutions to the actions of individuals”, making stories more
comprehensible for the readership (GOLDING; ELLIOTT, 1979, p. 122). In the case of
negative news, such as tragedies, the news value of personalisation is commonly shown
by emphasising a particular victim. In terms of gender, when portraying negative events
writers seem to opt for the female, since women victims appear to be more newsworthy
than the male with respect to negative circumstances (AITCHISON, 2006).
In relation to the linguistic resources that may construct the news value of
personalisation, Bednarek and Caple indicate the following devices:

7

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 1, p. 1-19, jan.-abr. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

References to ‘ordinary’ people, their emotions, experiences (Charissa Benjamin
and her Serbian husband, ‘It was pretty bloody scary’, But one of his victims
sobbed, Deborah said afterwards: ‘My sentence has only just begun’); use by news
actors/sources of ‘everyday’ spoken language, accent, sociolect (esp. in broadcast
news) (2017, p. 79, italics in the original).

The devices used to construct personalisation contrast with those that construe
eliteness, comprising of details about the age, personal description or gender role. These
linguistic resources serve to highlight the concreteness of the news actors, as well as to
prompt an emotional response from readers (FOWLER, 1994; MAÑOSO-PACHECO,
2017). Within the label of personalisation, vox populi quotes, first names and anaphoric
pronouns can also be included as they entail a non-elite label (LEDIN, 1996; BENAARON, 2005; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017).
In the case of reported speech, generally, those sources of information portrayed as
ordinary construct the news value of personalisation. Concerning the speech mode, a
direct reporting style is usually regarded as more personalising than other speech modes
as it allows the audience to access the voice of the individual directly (BEDNAREK;
CAPLE, 2017, p. 89). Nevertheless, this study focuses on the configuration of information
sources themselves rather than the way in which information is quoted in the discourse.
Finally, it should be noted that the news value of personalisation is both inherent
and text-dependent, since the discursive configuration of the source can determine low
status. For example, ‘real’ elite actors can construct personalisation if portrayed as
ordinary eye-witnesses involved in an event (BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017, p. 90). Thus, the
discourse of personalisation news value does not necessarily coincide with the actual
prestige of the information source.

4 Methodology
The present investigation is corpus-based and analyses contemporary articles
published online in 2014 in four broadsheet newspapers in Spain and Great Britain: El
Mundo, El País, The Times and The Guardian. The data collection was conducted in 2014
and based on random sampling. It comprises 68 digital articles, both national and
international, with an extension ranging from 164 to 1,122 words in length (including
headlines and subheadings). The British and Spanish press constitute two corpora that
were manually annotated in an Excel database; they have a total number of 20,001 and
20,477 words each, and 519 and 461 reporting segments respectively.
For the sampling purposes, the study is restricted to journalistic texts whose primary
concern was to inform readers about a particular event, i.e. articles that do not overtly
persuade the readership to perceive events from a particular angle (e.g. editorials). The
selected stories feature the topics of Education, Economy and Politics, and to a lesser
extent, Sports.
This paper formulates the following research question: what is the discourse of
eliteness and personalisation news values in the source of information? The data seeks
then to elaborate an inventory of linguistic devices, as well as possible discourse
tendencies that construct these newsworthy factors by analysing the source of information.

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

In order to analyse eliteness and personalisation, the databases classified sources
of information attending to its general characteristics, in particular, animacy value (human
vs. inanimate), the type of information source head (e.g. anaphoric allusion, role label,
family relationship, etc.) and its modifying elements present in the citation segment, such
as place of work, age reference or status-indicating adjectives. Considering the news actor
description (both head and modifiers, though the former carries more weight), sources of
both corpora were classified attending their resulting news value construal: (mostly)
eliteness or (mostly) personalisation. The research also annotated cases of ‘weak
personalisation’ or vox populi, such as ‘it is said that’, and reporting segments that do not
(clearly) construct any of these values, for instance, the impersonal pronoun ‘it’.
Although the research establishes four categories depending on the way the
information source constructs newsworthiness, only the coding of ‘pure’ news values has
been discussed and compared, i.e. eliteness and personalisation. As was already
indicated, these newsworthy categories do not necessarily coincide with the ‘real’ status of
the source, that is, the inherent news value of the agent, but the way the news actor is
portrayed in the discourse. Sometimes the very same person may construct the two news
values in the discourse, for instance, ‘the Ukip leader Nigel Farage’ (eliteness) vs. the
anaphoric reference ‘he’ (personalisation). Nevertheless, the configuration of eliteness in
the discourse is affected largely by the real-life conditions surrounding the status of the
agent, especially in the case of recognised names from politics.
Whilst the research presents a quantitative analysis of eliteness and
personalisation, the ambiguity present in the conceptualisation of these newsworthy
factors makes it possible to find a certain overlap in the categorisation of some cases. The
difficulty when classifying sources arises from the scalar value of these factors and is
reflected in the label description ‘mostly’. For instance, the elite ‘David Cameron’ identifies
the source using the name of the person, which may be regarded as more personalising
than saying ‘Mr. Cameron’, which in turn can be more personalising than using the role
label ‘Prime Minister’ (BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017). Similarly, the indication of the gender
of the source may be considered as more personalising than gender-neutral sources, as
this feature approaches readers with the human face of the news actor. On the other hand,
the ordinary source ‘relatives of the four men’ that refers to a group of people can be said
to be less personalising than the source ‘a teenager’, which refers to a single individual.
Indeed, some authors consider generic or group references as falling under the umbrella
of ‘weak personalisation’ (VAN LEEUWEN, 2008; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017).
Nevertheless, for ease of classification this category will be restricted to vox populi cases.
Regardless of the scalar nature of these values and the possible errors arising from misattributions of newsworthiness to the information source, the analysis allows for fine
distinctions to be drawn more precisely in future investigations concerning the discourse of
these values.

5 Results and discussion
The quantitative results for the different source categories concerning the news
values of eliteness and personalisation in the British and Spanish corpora are shown in

As may be noticed, Table 1 accounts for weak personalisation or vox populi cases.
They are hearsay markers (reportative evidentials), which mainly apply to reporting verbs
in the passive (‘was reported that’, ‘se especula que’ [there is speculation that]), and
reportative adverbs and adjectives, such as ‘seemingly’ or ‘presunta’ [alleged]. In weak
personalisation cases, the quoted evidence seems to come from speculation or common
knowledge by an undetermined mass of ordinary people.
Table 1 also indicates the number of reporting segments where there is not a (clear)
construct of eliteness and personalisation values. For instance, relative pronouns referring
back to an inanimate antecedent (‘which’, ‘that’), the impersonal pronoun ‘it’, and reporting
expressions with implicit sources appearing further back in the text, such as the non-finite
verb ‘saying’. As in both weak personalisation and unclear cases the source is not coded
explicitly, these categories fall outside the scope of the discussion that follows.
In both corpora, sources of information quoted as elites vastly outnumber
personalisation configurations, whose distribution is statistically significant (P<0.05)
according to the Chi-square test. In fact, in British newspapers there is a ratio of 15.05 in
contrast to 5.75 points applied to elites and ordinary sources, respectively. This finding
would correlate with Bell’s claim, which says that in the press “something is news just
because someone elite said it” (2001, p. 193). Therefore, the portrayal of sources as elite
seems to be a linguistic device that confers newsworthiness in the media papers analysed
in this study.
Table 2 below shows the most common linguistic devices that are found in the elite
group of both news groups, i.e., in information sources portrayed in a position of formal
authority or with prominent status.

personalisation news value. This fact may be reflected in the use of recognised names
with prestige, such as ‘David Cameron’ or ‘Le Pen’, a device that is much frequent in the
British corpus. Most of these sources come from political positions and depending on the
cultural background of the scholar and the time they examine them, the set level of status
might vary. Hence, the socio-cultural background of the researcher and the time frame of
the study can affect the results concerning this linguistic resource.
There are examples in the two corpora of role label configuration, such as ‘the
Prime minister’ or ‘the governor’. Being a socially validated authority seems to be a
prerequisite to give credit for the reported information, which is reflected discursively via
the indication of the place of work. For instance, ‘el experto en riesgos naturales y vocal
del Colegio de Geógrafos de España Jonathan Gómez Cantero’ [the expert on natural
hazards and member of the Association of Geographers of Spain Jonathan Gómez
Cantero] vs. ‘A teenager who disappeared in California 10 years ago’, the latter being an
unaffiliated individual.
The elite status of sources is also reinforced by the use of capital letters (‘Minister’
instead of ‘minister’), as well as pre-modifiers that allude to their rank or field of expertise,
as in ‘el vicepresidente Florian Philipott’ [the vice president Florian Philipott]. Besides, the
high position of the elite is enhanced by means of status-indicating adjectives (‘chief’,
‘leading’) and apposition nominal groups indicating the profession of the source, for
instance, ‘Boris Johnson, the London mayor’.
In the case of the British corpus, personal titles, such as ‘Mr’, ‘Dame’ or ‘Ms’, are
used to strengthen the prominent role of the information source. In Spanish newspapers,
on their part, there is a presence of ordinary people shaped as elite sources by means of
their affiliations to associations, organisations or institutions that defend their interests, as
in ‘la Plataforma Víctimas Alvia 04155’ [the Alvia 04155 Victims Platform].
In both corpora there are found a few ‘unknown’ elites, in the sense that the exact
identity of the sources remains unidentified for the readership, for example ‘officials’,
‘analysts’, ‘authorities’ or ‘sources’, to name but a few. Nevertheless, this linguistic device
is slightly more common in the British press, with a difference of 1.53 points in the ratio per
thousand words in comparison with the Spanish corpus.
Eliteness is not just restricted to human sources, a few metonymic expressions
denoting inanimate entities that enhance this newsworthy value are also found in the two
corpora. For example, ‘el ministerio’ [the ministry] or the acronym ‘SNCF’ (French National
Railway Company), which denote the institutions where powerful sources work. As regards
the discourse of inanimate elites, mostly having a broad scope, the use of status-indicating
adjectives is frequent in the British press, such as ‘central’ or ‘official’, as well as genitive
constructions, for example, ‘the Bank of England’ or ‘the government’s Health and Social
Care Information Centre’. The use of non-human elites to construct eliteness value is a
recurrent linguistic resource in both news groups, having a distribution of 3.90 and 4.54
ratio of tokens in the British and Spanish corpus, respectively.
The comparison between the Spanish and the British corpora as regards
personalisation news value is also statistically significant (P<0.05) according to the Chisquare test, as was already indicated in table 1. Although British sources may seem to
construct personalisation to a larger extent, the difference in the ratio in the two news
groups has to do with the properties of the language. In English, the subject must normally
appear in the phrase, whereas in Spanish its explicit coding is not mandatory. Indeed,
12

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

British newspapers construct many ordinary sources by means of anaphoric allusions,
such as personal pronouns.
Focusing on the discourse of this news value, Table 3 below indicates the variety of
linguistic devices that may construct this newsworthy factor.

Some of the most common linguistic resources that apply to personalisation
construal in the British corpus are possessive determiners belonging to the source
description (‘her’), relative pronouns in subject position referring back to people (‘who’),
and anaphoric pronouns in subject position (‘I’, ‘he’). In the Spanish news group there are
a few adverbial phrases initiating the citation segment that influence the configuration of
the source that follows by enhancing her/his personal face, for instance, ‘en su opinión’, ‘a
su juicio’ [in his/her opinion].
Other linguistic devices to construct personalisation that appear in both corpora
comprehend personal or family relationships (‘hermano del reportero australiano’ [the
brother of the Australian reporter]) and nationality or place of origin (‘la activista, nacida en
Barcelona en 1974’ [the activist, born in 1974 in Barcelona]), a resource which also
collocates with elite heads, as in ‘the Finnish premier’. The indication of provenance
applied to individuals is more prominent in the British corpus, exhibiting a ratio of 1.37 per
thousand words. There are a few other minor linguistic devices found that humanise
sources in the two news groups, such as the age of the news agent (‘most senior’) and
references to marital status (‘su exesposa, Laura Muñoz’ [his ex-wife, Laura Muñoz]), the
latter only present in Spanish newspapers.
The researcher must clarify that the indication of the place of origin by itself is not a
feasible indicator of personalisation construction, since there are, for instance, compound
adjectives (‘California-based’), pre-modifying nouns (‘London’) and compound nouns
acting as pre-modifiers that tend to collocate with elite heads, for instance, ‘Santa Ana
police’. Likewise, it should be noted that the use of first names in head position, a device
not applied to any corpora, does not always construct personalisation; for instance, if
preceded by a role label, as in papal names. Although early popes retained their birth
names, nowadays they adopt a new name upon their accession that does not coincide
with their baptismal name. Thus, the source ‘Pope Francis’, which is found in the British
14

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Belo Horizonte, v. 13, n. 1, p. 1-19, jan.-abr. 2020 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.13.1.1-19

corpus, has been regarded in the study as an elite compound designation.
The linguistic devices that construct personalisation are commonly found in long
chains of words in post-head position, clarifying the identity of the agent from a human
angle, as in this apposition embedding a restrictive relative clause ‘Nicola Evans, a friend
of Bridge who started the petition,’. Since ordinary sources are normally unknown for the
general public, there is a greater need than in elites to provide with further details in the
source description. These resources are also often part of Saxon genitive construction,
especially when referring to family relationships, as in ‘Mr Warren’s son-in-law’.
Finally, there are a few instances of negativity news value as a construal of
personalisation. The discourse configuration of ordinary folks by means of linguistic
devices of negativity can be exemplified in the information source ‘algunos testigos que
presenciaron el accidente’ [some witnesses who witnessed the accident]. This fact would
support the claim that the media frequently contact ordinary people to supply information
when they witness a negative event, such as a crime, a disaster or an accident. However,
this fact would require further investigation considering the reduced number of instances
found in the two corpora.

6 Conclusions
The present investigation has reviewed the discourse of news values in the source
of information. Based on previous studies in the field of critical discourse analysis (VAN
DIJK, 1988; BELL, 2001; BEDNAREK; CAPLE, 2017, amongst others), this research has
centred its study on eliteness and personalisation, in particular, the linguistic devices used
in the construal of these news factors in the source description.
Considering the results derived from the analysis, the researcher may conclude that
when dealing with sources of information, as one might expect, there seems to be a
greater approval for the use of elites playing the role of experts as a distinctive newsworthy
value in digital journalism. The identity of these sources sometimes remains unknown for
the readership, as in ‘officials’, ‘experts’ or ‘analysts’, enhancing their status.
As regards the discourse of eliteness, this news value was mostly characterised by
the presence of recognised names from politics (‘Barack Obama’, ‘Le Pen’), especially in
British newspapers, and the use of inanimate references with broad scope, such as ‘the
government’ or ‘Britain’. In the two corpora it was also common to see the use of role
labels that indicate the profession or field of expertise of the source (‘the mayor’, ‘the
judge’), generally appearing in apposition. Besides, status-indicating modifiers were used
to reinforce the position of news actors (‘leading’, ‘official’), though this was not so
frequently observed in the news groups. Finally, the use of personal titles, such as ‘Mr’ or
‘Dame’, was a recurrent linguistic device found in British newspapers in order to enhance
the elite position of the information source.
In the case of personalisation, this newsworthy factor was mostly constructed in the
British corpus by means of anaphoric allusions, namely relative pronouns, pronouns in
subject position and possessive determiners. The linguistic devices to construct
personalisation also comprised reference to marital status, age details and family
relationships, the latter frequently embedded in Saxon genitive and appositional
constructions. Moreover, the indication of provenance or place of origin was a recurrent
15

linguistic device in the British corpus. In line with previous research, the news value of
negativity seems to marginally construct ordinary folks. However, this research paradigm
requires more in-depth examination as the number of instances constructing these news
values is reduced in both corpora.
The study would suggest further research with respect to the extra-journalist and
organisational selection decisions taken in the editorial conferences. Extensive
investigation would also be needed regarding the compatibility of the information source
with the newspaper’s bias, the so-called ‘consonance’ news value. The researcher has not
yet reached the various ideological lines supposedly held in society and mirrored by the
digital press, and so an all-encompassing analysis that may help readers better direct their
information processing would be desirable as a vibrant continuation of this investigation.
