ABSTRACT: This article investigates the reaction, on Twitter, to Pope Benedict XVI’s
resignation announcement. Specifically, this is a qualitative study in linguistic anthropology
of how memes and hashtags circulated on Twitter between the day of the announcement
of said resignation and the Pope’s last day in office, and identifies the speech chains
created by them. The analysis of the corpus showed that Twitter users' deployment of
hashtags serves two purposes: on the one hand, it creates a topic/comment structure that
is later reproduced, modified or abandoned by other users. On the other hand, hashtags
function as performative acts that create online ad hoc communities. In addition, this article
also claims that English and Romance-language users created and circulated image and
text-based memes differently, thus establishing two language-based speech chains. In
sum, this article contributes to discussions on informational flux on online platforms by
demonstrating that said flux does have constraints, and that those constraints are related
to language-based communities of practice.
KEYWORDS: Twitter. Speech chains. Hashtags. Memes.
RESUMO: O presente trabalho investiga a reação, no Twitter, ao anúncio da renúncia do
Papa Benedito XVI. Trata-se de um estudo qualitativo, em antropologia linguística, de
como memes e hashtags circularam no Twitter entre o anúncio da renúncia e o último dia
de trabalho do Papa, com o objetivo de identificar as cadeias de fala criadas por estes
memes e hashtags. A análise do corpus mostrou que emprego de hashtags pelos
usuários do Twitter serve a dois propósitos: por um lado, cria-se uma estrutura tópicocomentário que é, depois, reproduzida, modificada ou abandonada por outros usuários.
Por outro lado, as hashtags funcionam como enunciados performativos que criam
comunidades online. Ademais, o presente artigo também afirma que usuários de língua
inglesa e de línguas românicas criaram e circularam memes baseados em imagens e
textos de maneiras distintas, estabelecendo, consequentemente, duas cadeias de fala
baseadas nas suas respectivas línguas. Em resumo, este artigo contribui para as
discussões sobre o fluxo informacional em plataformas online, ao demonstrar que há
restrições a esse fluxo e que tais restrições estão relacionadas às línguas das diferentes
comunidades de prática.
PALAVRAS-CHAVE: Twitter. Cadeias de fala. Hashtags. Memes.

1 The exiting Pope
11 February 2013. Shortly after Benedict XVI announced his upcoming resignation,
the following image started circulating on Facebook:

Picture 1: Papus Interruptus on Libération.
Source: <http://journal.liberation.fr/publication/liberation/1161/?
utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter#!/0_0>.

At first, one could wonder why such an image should be considered novel. After all,
it was just another attack on the Catholic Church by a left-wing French publication.
However, it was more than that. The picture had an embedded link which took the reader
to the first page of the corresponding report on Libération’s website. In order to read the
following pages, it was necessary to subscribe to the magazine – and pay for it. But the
use of a capitalist technique by a self-proclaimed leftist publication was just one of the
multi-layered discourses present on the cover of that Libération’s ssue.
The use of Broken Latin was also significant. Latin was the language Ratzinger
chose to announce his resignation, which made it virtually impossible for those gathered in
St. Peter’s Square to understand what the Pope was actually saying. By using Broken
Latin on its cover, Libération referenced both the uttering of the resignation itself, and the
lack of Latin fluency of most Catholics. Furthermore, the syntax and morphology used by
Libération – the fictive nominative form papus followed by the past participle interruptus –
mirrors another popular Latin phrase: coitus interruptus. In other words, the publication
was also referencing the Church’s long-standing ban on contraceptive methods. Needless
to say, the picture went viral and the hashtag #papusinterruptus was one of the trending
topics on Twitter within minutes.
The wide circulation of this magazine-cover-turned-into-meme raises some
questions. In the first place, the length of the hashtag challenges claims (cf. SIMMONS et
al., 2011) according to which shorter hashtags are the ones that make it to Twitter
stardom. In the second place, and more importantly, the wide circulation of the meme and
the hashtag among speakers of various languages – none of them Broken Latin! – would

seem to validate two theories. Firstly, it might indicate that Appadurai (1990) is correct, that
post-globalization reality is indeed completely fluid, and that cultural scenarios face no
restrictions when travelling around the globe. In particular, the #papusinterruptus
phenomenon shows the free-flowing nature of ideoscapes and mediascapes. Secondly,
and this is a corollary of the previous point, individual languages do not matter so much in
this day and age. Now, we would be experiencing a post-varieties era in which messages
are more relevant than the languages used to convey them (SEARGENT, TAGG, 2011).
Nevertheless, these hypotheses will prove problematic if one continues to investigate how
Pope-related memes circulated in the days following Benedict XVI resignation
announcement.
The arguments presented in this study contradict both Simmons’ (2001) and
Appadurai’s (1990) claims. In this article, I argue that, contrary to what one might think at
first, certain cultural scenarios (APPADURAI, 1990) do not flow freely, and that individual
languages still matter. Pope-related memes that circulated on Twitter in the days following
11 February 2013 illustrate that Twitter users perform language-based communities
through the creation, replication, and modification of specific hashtags. In other words,
tweeters self-organize around speech chains 1 (AGHA, 2003) they themselves craft. These
speech chains engender language-based circuits that constrain the circulation of different
types of memes, thus creating different communities. Hashtags and memes are the most
prominent tool tweeters use to perform their belonging to a given community.
The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, I expand on the critique of Appadurai’s
(1990) concept of cultural scapes, and present the concept of speech chain (AGHA, 2003).
After that, I explore some of the affordances of Twitter and how they are dealt with by
Twitter users. The following section is on methodology and data collection. Finally, the data
is presented and analyzed before I present my concluding tweets.

2 Speech chains and the circulation of cultural scenarios
In his effort to understand (post)modern processes, Appadurai (1990) avoids
engaging in an archeological enterprise in a Foucauldian sense – in other words,
Appadurai does not aim at unveiling the historical and discursive roots of contemporary
practices. According to the author, the past is “not a land to return to […] it has become a
synchronic warehouse of cultural scenarios” (APPADURAI, 1990, p. 4). Appadurai focuses
on the synchronic organization of the aforementioned cultural scenarios, or landscapes,
which are five: ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, financescapes, and ideoscapes
(APPADURAI, 1990, p. 6-7). Appadurai’s tone is celebratory: reality is fluid, and there is a
constant flux of people, information, technology, capital, and ideologies. In fact, Appadurai
(1990) affirms that “both points of departure and points of arrival are in cultural flux, and
thus the search for steady points of reference, as critical life choices are made, can be
very difficult” (APPADURAI, 1990, p. 18). This claim does not conflict with other claims
made by social scientists such as Spitulnik (1997) and Squires (2010), who agree upon
the fact that searching for points of departure might be an impossible enterprise, if not
completely irrelevant.

In this article, the nouns and phrases speech chains, networks, and communities of practice are used
interchangeably, to avoid repetition. The concept of speech chains, as defined by Agha (2003) and
explained in Section 2 of this paper, is the one being referred to each time one of these phrases is used.
3

Finally, Appadurai’s theory might be particularly seductive to those familiar with
Deleuze’s and Guattari’s (1987) concept of rhizome: a multissemiotic and multilayered
structure whose points of departure and arrival are not identifiable, and that connect
multiple points in multiple dimensions. However, one must note that Deleuze, Guattari,
Spitulnik and Squires all emphasized that there are constraints to the mobility of meanings
and forms, whereas Appadurai did not investigate who and what is able to travel and to
experience the deterritorialization process he describes.
In fact, many scholars have pointed out deficiencies in Appadurai’s celebration of
free-flowing manyscapes. For instance, Boellstorff (2003) notes that the circulation of
cultural scenarios is restricted, and even determined, by local subjectivities. For instance,
subjectivities, like the gay and lesbi ones in Indonesia, are crafted in the disjuncture
between tradition and modernity – and modernity is usually identified with the Indonesian
nation-state, not necessarily a global flow of mediascapes. When studying the Caribbean,
Freeman (2001) argues that the circulation of people, technology, and goods in Barbados
is not unrestrained, but rather conditioned by specific political and economic
arrangements. These arrangements engender positionalities and circuits, thus
constraining what circulates, and how the circulation occurs. Finally, Jacquemet (2005)
demonstrates that Argentine telenovelas are successful in Albania only if they are dubbed
in Italian. In other words, local ideologies of symbolic and economic capital take
precedence over the fetishization of originality, and media products do not just “fly”, in spite
of technological affordances. This study contributes to this stream of scholarship which
seeks to understand how the circulation of cultural landscapes is constrained. In particular,
since my goal here is to understand the circulation of linguistic messages on Twitter, the
concept of speech chains is especially useful. According to Agha (2003), a speech chain is
[a] historical series of speech events linked together by the permutation of
individuals across speech-act roles in the following way: the receiver of the
message in the (n)th speech event is the sender of the message in the (n+1) th
speech event […] where the terms ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ […] are variable names
for interactional roles specified in different ways at different points along the speech
chain (AGHA, 2003, p. 247).

Two of the points made by Agha (2003) deserve clarification. In the first place, this
definition is not concerned with identifying points of departure or arrival. Tracing speech
chains is a way to understand how cultural values are transmitted and changed – not
where they came from or where they will end up. Secondly, speech chains are not
necessarily connected to traditional accounts of dyadic interactions where participant A is
the sender of the message and participant B is the mere receiver. The concept of speech
chains allows for a more dynamic – and realistic – understanding of the production and
circulation of cultural values. For instance, the sender may be a collective subject, such as
mass media, and the receiver may be multiple, or each speaker may be both the audience
and the initiator of a speech chain at the same time (AGHA, 2003; SQUIRES, 2010) 2. With
Agha’s (2003) definitions in mind, I argue that Twitter users construct, circulate and
negotiate cultural values through language-based speech chains.

In other words, speech chains are potentially rhizomatic (DELEUZE, GUATTARI, 1987; JACQUEMET,
2005).

3 The medium and its affordances
Twitter, released in 2006, is now one of the most popular social media platforms
alongside Facebook. Although there is a plethora of conversational triggers (ZUBIAGA et
al., 2011), roughly half of the posts on Twitter, also known as tweets, are about
entertainment and sports (CHEONG, 2009), and Twitter usage increases significantly
during prominent events, such as the World Cup or the Olympics (BECKER et al., 2011).
The expressive quantity of tweets during prominent events, and the relative short life of
trending topics (BRUNS, 2012), may be related to the affordances of the medium. Each
tweet cannot exceed 140 characters, which favors the communication of short informative
messages rather than analytical ones.
But the medium also has other affordances. For example, all tweets are publicly
visible by default. This means that twitter-users, also known as tweeters, cannot
differentiate between categories such as “best friends”, “friends”, “acquaintances”, or
“public” when selecting their target audience. Nevertheless, tweeters have managed to
compensate for these constraints by taking advantage of affordances offered by Twitter.
For example, each username is preceded by the “@” sign. When a tweetter wants to make
sure that another user will be aware of something (s)he posts, (s)he just needs to tag the
target user by including the target’s username (@username) in his(her) tweet. Another
affordance designed by Twitter developers is the follower/followee network. Users may
subscribe to other users’ tweets and vice-versa, thus creating a community of
writers/readers.
When the affordance is not there, users create it. For example, tweeters started
using the hash (#) symbol to indicate the topic of their tweets. The ubiquity of this practice
led Twitter managers to incorporate it into Twitter design by making hashtags searchable
(ZAPPAVIGNA, 2011). This development allowed for the creation of two overlapping
networks: the default follower/followee network, and the relatively more recent hashtagbased one (BRUNS, BURGESS, 2011).
Although nowadays only 30% of the trending topics are hashtagged (BRUNS,
2012), this mechanism has proven extremely powerful. In the first place, it allows users to
structure their tweets in a topic/comment format, in which the hashtag indexes the shared
topic and each individual tweet is a comment (HUANG et al., 2010).
Additionally, hashtags are linguistic technologies which make phrases extractable
(BAUMAN, BRIGGS, 1990) by design, thus facilitating their enregisterment in distinct
contexts (SQUIRES, 2010). As has been noted by Spitulnik (1997), the circulation of
discourses across communities, their transformation into “public words” (SPITULNIK,
1997, p. 166) and usage in contexts where they apparently do not belong may trigger
humor. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in the circulation of memes, humorous
posts that account for approximately 12% of tweets (CHEONG, 2009). Tweeters often
engage in meme-replicating practices, thus indexing solidarity (ZAPPAVIGNA, 2012) and
creating a network that goes beyond the originally designed follower/followee structure.
What is more, hashtag usage requires constant monitoring, as seen below.

Picture 2: Monitoring Hashtags.
Source: <https://twitter.com/roygrubb/status/307126698275663873>.

In the example above, the user asks which hashtag was being used on 28 February
2013, Ratzinger’s last day as Pope Benedict XVI. By asking this question, the user
demonstrates his awareness of the ever-changing hashtag landscape, and also indicates
his will to use the relevant hashtag and thus secure his membership in one of the many
hashtag-based communities.
Despite its frequency, the use of hashtags is a possibility, not a requirement. Users
may choose not to hashtag their tweets, or to use innovative hashtags that do not
necessarily correspond to any given ongoing conversation. Therefore, by using and
reproducing a specific hashtag, users are (i) explicitly indicating their desire to participate
in a given exchange and (ii) creating and maintaining a certain topic-based conversation.
In other words, hashtags can be understood as performative statements: they create,
reproduce, and defy ad-hoc publics (BRUNS, BURGESS, 2011).

4 Methodological mazes
This study analyzes tweets that were published from 11 February 2013 to 29
February 2013. These dates cover the period between the announcement of Joseph
Ratzinger’s resignation until his last day in office. All tweets mentioned here address
Ratzinger’s resignation in a humorous or sarcastic way.
Although it is true that hashtags make tweets searchable (ZAPPAVIGNA, 2011), the
default searchability is quite limited: Twitter’s proprietary search engine only allows users
to search for hashtags that were published within the last 48 hours. Nevertheless, timelimit constraints on the searchability of hashtags are not the sole challenge of Twitterbased research. Endogenous (or “local”) and exogenous (or “non-local”) trends present
different rates of hashtagging and retweeting (NAAMAN et al., 2011). Since what might be
considered local by some users may be considered exogenous by others, it is not always
possible to verify the ubiquity of a given meme. For instance, memes tracing parallels
between Benedict XVI and the on-again off-again Italian prime-minister Silvio Berlusconi
may be considered endogenous by Italy-based users and exogenous by users based in
other countries. This fact may entail retweeting with or without hashtagging.
Additionally, the circulation of twitter memes is affected by competing influences.
Some users are “more likely to replicate/retweet the behavior of someone who is seen as
having stature or authority” (PONTORIERO, GILLE, s/d, p. 5-6) while others tend to
replicate the behavior of their closest acquaintances. Moreover, there is a third group, one
that does not “discriminate among sources of tweets, only content” (PONTORIERO,
GILLE, s/d, p. 5). Consequently, the amount of retweets might not be indicative of the
popularity of a given tweet.

It is true that the issues mentioned above might hinder the reliability of any
quantitative study of Twitter. Nevertheless, it is possible to conduct a qualitative study that
focuses on the mechanisms of the circulation of hashtags and memes rather than on the
amount of retweets a given post has. In order to do this research, I created a Twitter
account and followed users who had retweeted the #papusinterruptus hashtag. I also
searched for hashtags which were potentially related to the Pope, such as #papa and
#pope. Searching for these hashtags took me to yet other hashtags, such as #vatican,
#vaticano, #novopapa, #dimissioniPapa, and #pontifixit, among others.
This method had two main advantages. On the one hand, I was able to participate
in two overlapping types of Twitter networks: the follower/followee and the hashtag-based
ones. On the other hand, this seemed to be a more natural way of collecting data, for it
allowed me to navigate Twitter as users of social media usually do it: by starting with a
topic of interest and then allowing myself to explore related posts. By doing so, I could
witness the creation and abandonment of hashtags – and their respective ad hoc
communities. The hashtags I encountered were written mainly in Italian, Portuguese,
Galician, French, and English3. The most common hasthags in English were4:
Table 1: Common hashtags in English, in alphabetical order.
#Benedict
#ExBenedict
#fuckthepope
#fuckthisshit
#papadontpreach
#papusinterruptus
#pontifexit
#pope
#popexit
#ThePope
#Vatican

Since the orthography of some words coincide in a variety of Romance languages
(“papa”, for instance, is found in Galician, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish), I decided to
collate Romance-language hashtags in a single group even when some of the hashtags
were clearly written in one specific Romance language (for example, “#dimissionidelpapa”
is Italian and “#chegadessamerda” is Brazilian Portuguese). I also included in this list
English-language hashtags that accompanied Romance-language texts:

4

Curiously, even when the researched hashtag contained potential Spanish words, such as #papa,
Spanish-language Pope-related memes did not seem to be common.
Since this is a qualitative study, providing figures on the number of tweets in the corpus could be
misleading. For instance, it could lead the reader to infer that a hashtag that was not frequent in the
corpus was not frequent at the time, which may or may not be true. To avoid such misinterpretations, I
will provide lists of hashtags I encountered in alphabetical order.

At this juncture, a note of caution is necessary since this article is not only about
hashtags and memes, but also about the crafting of speech chains. I do not intend to imply
that users who tweet in Italian are based in Italy, or that those who tweet in Galician are in
Galicia. It is important to note that all personal information available on Twitter is selfreported, and might be conflictive. For instance, not all users disclose their location, some
users state they are in more than one country at the same time, the language a user posts
in does not necessarily correspond to any language spoken in the country (s)he affirms to
be in, etc. (CHEONG, 2009). Furthermore, since I understand hashtags as communitymaking performative statements, I am not interested in unveiling which language a given
user speaks natively. Instead, I am interested in understanding which performative
statement a user produces when (s)he uses language A and not language B. In other
words, the concept of “locale” is important in this study, but “locale” does not translate into
“place”. The locales I discuss here are linguistic locales, performatively created and
sustained – or abandoned – by users every time they hashtag their tweets.

5 Producing and circulating memes
Pope-related memes seemed to be distributed in two distinct groups: image-based
memes and text-based memes. I call text-based memes those memes which have no
pictorial components except for the user’s profile picture. I call image-based memes those
memes whose main source of humor is either (i) fully concentrated in a picture, including
commercial logos or (ii) emergent from the interaction between text and image. When
collecting data, I noticed that English-language tweeters and Romance-language tweeters
presented different trends regarding the production and circulation of Pope-related
memes.
5.1

English-language tweeters

The occurrence of image and text-based memes seemed to be balanced among
English-language tweeters. Image-based tweets could rely solely on the image itself, as
seen below.

Users who retweeted exclusively image-based memes, such as those in (3) and (4),
tended to replicate both the picture and the hashtag. The same tendency was observable
among memes which combined image and text:

Whereas image-based tweets tend to be replicated as they are – image and
hashtag – text-based memes present a different pattern. Pope-related text-based tweets
do not seem to differ from other text-based tweets. The hashtag tends to be replicated
while the text is changed.
Text-based tweets exhibited a different pattern. For instance, tweets hashtagged
#fuckthepope normally contain critiques of pedophilia practiced by members of the
Catholic Church. Moreover, they openly accuse Ratzinger of trying to protect priests
involved in child abuse. Examples (8) and (9), below, illustrate the topic/comment format of
text-based tweets (HUANG et al., 2010). In addition, they demonstrate that hashtag users
are aware of the array of comments that are relevant to a given topic.

Picture 9: #fuckthepope - geriatric pervert.

Although a hashtag such as #fuckthepope may invite a plethora of anti-Pope
statements, Twitter users know exactly which set of comments is adequate to the
community they want to belong to, thus clearly indicating their orientation toward the
formation and maintenance of a hashtag-based speech chain. Contrary to text-based
tweets, image-based tweets rely less on the creativity and personal opinions of individual
users. Both topic and comment are provided, and the user joins the community simply by
replicating them.
5.2

Romance-language tweeters

Exclusively image-based memes also circulated among Romance-language
tweeters, as observable in (10):

12

Picture 10: Ceci n'est pas un pape.
Source: <https://twitter.com/shawnsobers/status/301468234182426624>.

The meme above explicitly references Magritte’s famous work:

The explicit intertextuality translated into popularity, and (10) circulated even among
non-Romance language speakers. In fact, image-based tweets seemed to be more
popular among Romance-language tweeters than among English-language tweeters.
However, image-based tweets exhibited a different behavior when circulating among
Romance-language tweeters, as seen below.

Tweets (12)-(15) exhibit a different pattern than the one observed in image-based
tweets as circulated by English-language tweeters. Romance-language tweeters tended to
maintain the hashtag, but change the picture.
Therefore, it is possible to argue that Romance-language tweeters treated imagebased tweets like English-language tweeters treated text-based ones. In other words, the
image was understood as a personal comment that was changed to conform to each
individual user’s point of view, whereas the maintenance of the hashtag indexes belonging
to a larger community.
Additionally, the themes present in image-based tweets as circulated by English and
15

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Ano: 2015 – Volume: 8 – Número: 1

Romance-language tweeters vary. It is true that tweets related to alternative career paths
for the Pope are present among both English (examples 3-5) and Romance-language
tweeters (examples 12-14). However, criticizing Ratzinger for being a quitter seems to be
more frequent among English-language users (6) than among Romance-language ones.
Also, English-language users seem to be more likely to criticize the Church for trying to get
away with pedophilia (7). Romance-language users, on the other hand, seem to
concentrate their critique on Ratzinger’s former Nazi enthusiasm (15). Text-based tweets
also circulated among Romance-language users.

Picture 16: #NovoPapa - Lula.

Picture 17: #NovoPapa - Luiz Inácio II.
Source: <https://twitter.com/Miyudo/status/301711643900010498>.

The pattern of production and circulation of text-based memes among Romancelanguage tweeters mirrors that of English-language tweeters. The hashtag is replicated
whereas the text changes, thus illustrating the topic/comment format of text-based tweets.
Moreover, although the hashtag #NovoPapa (New Pope) certainly invites an array of
comments, users know which comments are relevant in a given hashtag community. For
example, both (16) and (17) offer comments about the former Brazilian president Luís
Inácio Lula da Silva, who was president for two consecutive terms, elected his successor,
Dilma Rousseff, and – rumor has it – wants to run again. Tweets (16) and (17) suggest that
such a power-hungry person would be a good candidate for a life-term position, like that of
the Bishop of Rome.

6 Restrictions on the circulation of memes
Examples (3)-(17) illustrate that tweets circulate differently among English and
Romance-language tweeters. These examples also demonstrate that the production of
tweets also presents differences. English-language users treat image and text-based
tweets differently, and do not seem to favor one or the other. Romance-language users
seem to favor image over text-based tweets, and treat them alike by preserving the topic
(the hashtag) and changing the comment (the text or the image).
Furthermore, as Naaman et al. (2011) observed, the endogenous or exogenous
nature of tweets also affect their circulation. For example, tweets like 16 and 17, which
explicitly reference a Brazilian politician, circulated widely among Brazilian Portuguese16

language users, but did not seem to be popular among users who tweeted in other
languages. This is also true for image-based tweets, such as the ones below.

Picture 18: 'The new Pope will restitute faith'.

Picture 19: 'Secret revealed'.

Tweets 18 and 19 both reference Italian former Prime-Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Tweet 18 alludes to allegedly endemic corruption during Berlusconi’s tenure, while tweet
19 alludes to supposedly promiscuous relations between the Catholic Church and the
State under Berlusconi’s rule. Endogenous tweets also circulated among Brazilian
Portuguese-language users:

17

Picture 20: #partiu #vaticano.
Source: <pic.twitter.com/1EQek4bf7L>.

The character depicted in (20), Inri Cristo, is a Brazilian man who claims to be the
reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Tweet 20 shows him on his motorcycle, and the embedded
hashtags, which are reproduced by the tweeter, indicate that Inri Cristo in on his way to the
Vatican to finally claim St. Peter’s throne.
Memes like 18-20, which may require specific cultural knowledge, had a more
restricted circulation: tweeters who tweeted mostly in Italian and Brazilian Portuguese,
respectively, replicated them. Additionally, although Romance-language users oriented to
engaging in exchanges conducted primarily in Romance languages, there were
exceptions:

18

Picture 21: European Portuguese: The Pope quits.
Source: <pic.twitter.com/P7kEsLCc>.

Tweet 21 shows that English-language memes also circulated among Romancelanguage users. More specifically, example (21) demonstrates that an English-language
tweet was replicated accompanied by introductory remarks made in a Romance language
(in this case, European Portuguese). Nevertheless, this bilingual pattern is not always
observed among Romance-language tweeters.

Picture 22: #fuckthisshit.

Similarly to example 1 (#papusinterruptus), example 22 (#fuckthisshit) circulated
widely on Twitter, and also made it to the trending topics. However, users who tweet
mostly in Brazilian Portuguese circulated a different version of this meme:
19

Picture 23: #chegadessamerda (“Fuck this shit! I quit”).
Source: <http://c4.quickcachr.fotos.sapo.pt/i/B9411cdad/14611036_Md6hM.jpe g>.

The Brazilian Portuguese version differs from the English one in significant ways.
The disposition of the pictures which compose the English-language meme is organized
differently, the text is circumscribed by a speech bubble which resembles those of Brazilian
graphic novels, and the Brazilian Portuguese text is colloquial and its first half has a
syntactic structure not shared with other Romance languages, not even European
Portuguese. These semiotic processes can be understood not as an appropriation of
foreign categories, but rather as a local interpretation of widely circulating signs. In other
words, the Brazilian rendition of the meme is not translation, but an instance of dubbing
(BOELLSTORFF, 2003); i.e.: the designing of local categories vis-à-vis global ones,
mediated by national ideologies. More specifically, this particular meme might indicate that,
among some Brazilian Portuguese-language users, anti-religious sentiment is conflated
with an anti-English language stance.

7 Final tweets
Although research on Twitter presents a myriad of challenges, as exposed in
section 4 (Methodological Mazes), it is possible to draw a few conclusions based on the
sample selected for this study. They are: (i) hashtags matter, (ii) language matters, and (iii)
tweets are potentially rhizomatic.
It is through the use of hashtags that one makes his tweet searchable
(ZAPPAVIGNA, 2011) even if for a short period of time due to Twitter affordances. By
choosing to hashtag his post, each Twitter user performs his affiliation to a certain
community by indicating the conversational topic in which he is engaging and contributing
a comment to the exchange. The fact that hashtags are only searchable for a short period
of time does not seem to impact the formation of ad hoc publics negatively. As example 2
shows, users are aware of the hashtag changes, and negotiate those changes in order to
maintain their status as a member of a given community. The use of hashtags as
performative speech acts by all tweets analyzed here ratify previous research, such as
20

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Ano: 2015 – Volume: 8 – Número: 1

Bruns and Burgess’s (2011) – according to whom hashtags function as performative
speech acts of belonging to a certain community.
Nevertheless, hashtags are not the only fact that matters; language also does. For
instance, English and Romance-language tweeters treat image and text-based tweets
differently. English-language tweeters showed no preference for one type of tweet over the
other. Additionally, they kept the topic in textual exchanges (the hashtags) while changing
the comments (their personal remarks). Image-based tweets were treated differently: the
topic and the comment (the picture) were replicated without being modified by the users.
Romance-language tweeters exhibited a different pattern. There was a preference
for image-based tweets over solely textual ones. Moreover, both sorts of tweets were
treated similarly: users clearly performed affiliation to a community by keeping the
conversational hashtag, and tended to change the comment regardless of its nature (text
or image). One could conclude, therefore, that the English and Romance-language
tweeters studied here perform being part of a community differently, which entails the
existence of distinct felicity conditions. For instance, changing the image would be
infelicitous in an English-language speech chain, whereas not changing it would be
infelicitous in a Romance-language one. Since linguistic differences are relevant for the
formation of speech chains that have their own felicity conditions, it seems that this might
not be the time to fully implement a post-varieties approach to language, as defended by
Seargent and Tagg (2011).
Finally, tweets are potentially rhizomatic, in Deleuze's and Guattari’s (1987) sense.
Speech chains on Twitter are formed around porous language-related lines of force that
correspond to different manners of producing and transmitting messages. Consequently,
any given user does more than simply stating one personal stance on a particular topic
every time he hashtags his post. Along with his particular opinion, each individual tweeter
is also performing his affiliation to a specific ad hoc community (through the use of a
hashtag) and to a broader speech chain (via the language he uses, and the restraints
associated with it). Furthermore, besides performing all these affiliations, users can also
combine the expression of multiple sentiments. For instance, it seems that tweeters who
posted in Brazilian Portuguese oriented to conflating an anti-Catholic Church stance with
an anti-English language one. This demonstrates that cultural values face limitations to
their circulation, including local interpretations of global events and nationalistic stances.
In sum, these findings demonstrate that the free-flowing, post-globalization reality
taken for granted by Appadurai (1990) is not ubiquitous. In spite of being porous,
language-based lines of force are indeed performed by tweeter users. In fact, at least in
the corpus studied here, language does circumscribe the production and circulation of
messages. Additionally, the messages that circulate are crafted in a rhizomatic manner.
They encompass a series of stances which reference other tweet-rhizomes available in
and out of the Twitter sphere.
