{"title":"Cognitive research and automatic translation in jurilinguistics","language":"french","abstract":"Due to its  morphophonological, morphosyntactic, lexical and other systems and subsystems of its functioning, the Arabic language represents a system of non-concatenation (or non-chaining of morphemes). It differs in this sense from Indo-European languages - with concatenation systems - and remains, so to speak, a fairly complex language to manage in the field of Automatic Language Processing (NLP).  This happens especially when it comes to automatically translating language facts that carry cultural elements specific to that language. The data examined in this article is indicative of the gap resulting from an automatic translation of Arabic legal texts into other languages such as French or English. The genetically different nature of the languages in question not only poses problems of linguistic nature in the passage from one language to another, but also and above all it makes the comprehension of legal texts in Arabic difficult, since they carry semantic, cultural, religious and civilizational loads that do not always reflect the same referents or gestalt of the target languages. It is concluded that human intervention in this translation process is more than necessary as revealed by the study of legal texts in Saudi Arabia.
