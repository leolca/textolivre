{"title":"Educational and social inclusion of Internet of Things in neurodiversity","language":"spanish","abstract":"This study aims to check if the Internet of Things (IoT) is inclusive at an educational and social level for people with neurodiversity. The research design is non-experimental, explanatory and correlational. In this article, a Likert scale validated in content and construct is used. The sample is made up of 726 participants (computer engineers and university students in the first year of the Primary Education degree). For the study, an Exploratory Factor Analysis was performed in order to validate the construction of the scale, and in addition, a Spearman's Rho correlation. This study allows us to make some conclusions, among them that educational inclusion takes into account social inclusion, as well as that educational inclusion takes into account the needs of schoolchildren and favors the academic performance of students, using the IoT as a benefit for the comprehensive development of the student both to function in the academic environment and in life in society.
