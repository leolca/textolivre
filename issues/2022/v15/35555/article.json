To do so, we initially present an overview of the field of digital literature and some of its main terminological issues. Subsequently, we describe in detail the structure and functions of the corpus, as well as its place within the canon of electronic literature, before we in fact analyze the selected thematic routes. By means of hypertextual close reading, the discussions in the article show the richness of this digital and multimodal work, which could be read according to various interpretive paths, from which we highlight two interpretative routes built on thematic recurrences among interconnected fragments about the life and work of Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Moreover, this article reflects on the challenges to interpreting digital hypertextual works as this one, highlighting the methodological choices inherent to the analysis of a cultural object with such mediatic and semiotic specificities.
