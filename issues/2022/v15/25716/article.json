The objective of this article is to analyze the perception of the level of mastery of social skills by graduate students, with an innovative design course that integrated the method of Architecture of Horizons, as well as emerging technologies (virtual reality, augmented, open resources and interactive videos) for the construction of entrepreneurship projects that contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. The study method was mixed, with concurrent triangulation, where Likert scales of social entrepreneurship and innovation were applied, as well as focus group, to a population of 65 students, in a distance learning course. The results show the perception of disruptive educational innovation in the design of the course and the development of social entrepreneurship competence, mainly in the sub-competencies of social value, leadership and personal. This article may be of value to students, teachers, researchers, and decision makers interested in educational innovation and entrepreneurship.
