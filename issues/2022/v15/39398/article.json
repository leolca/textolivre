{"title":"Towards a social-semiotic approach to visual analysis of two-dimensional games: a toolkit","language":"english","abstract":"Nowadays, video games are one of the most influential media from an economic and sociocultural point of view. Therefore, it is important to have tools to analyze such texts and the meanings and discourses they potentially convey. Based on the social-semiotic approach, this paper proposes a set of analytical categories to study the visual construction of 2D (two-dimensional) games. Although the 2D paradigm is no longer prevalent in video games — 3D (three-dimensional) games became gradually common as early as 1995 with the introduction of the Sony PlayStation — it is still used in several current titles. Furthermore, social-semiotic studies on video games are still not numerous; therefore, a focused study that systematizes methodological categories for the analysis of video games is a relevant step towards understanding the semiotic constitution of these artifacts. The present study focuses on Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems for the Super Nintendocapcom_marvel_1996. By applying the categories presented here on the Brazilian stage of the game, this article suggests ways to analyze the visual mode of video games, taking into account their multimodal nature and discursive potential.
