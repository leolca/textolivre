{"title":"“That’s news to me! Gringo wants to teach us how to speak our own language”: language ideologies and identity positioning on a Facebook page","language":"portuguese","abstract":"In this article, we aim to investigate identity positionings negotiated between social media users. We rely on communicative practices on a Facebook page, “Greengo Dictionary”, to analyze and discuss posts and comments through a discourse-centered online qualitative study. To this end, we draw on the notions of virtual communityrecuero_comunidades_2009, discourse communityswales_repensando_1992,araujo_comunidade_2020, stancesbarton_linguagem_2015, positioningharre_positioning_1999, and tactics of intersubjectivitybucholtz_language_2004,bucholtz_identity_2005, which provided us with opportunities to understand the discursive construction of identity positioning and the language ideologies underlying the use of English and Portuguese online. In conclusion, we observe that while engaging in fluid and hybrid language practices, Facebook users position themselves in relation to a wide range of communicative purposes, which highlight not only the creativity and humor that characterize the Greengo Dictionary page, but also the linguistic normativism that contributes to the development of different identity relations.
