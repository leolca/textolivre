{"title":"From the contact between Literature, Corpus Linguistics and Natural Language Processing: the case of the anagrammatics of Guimarães Rosa","language":"portuguese","abstract":"From the attempt to realize the cooperation between Corpus Linguistics and the Natural Language Processing (NLP), were created important products, as the possibility of proccess lots of linguistic’s data and the development of technologies that use language. The relationship between those areas and the Literary Studies, however, has been less studied, opening spaces for this work, which has the objective of doing an exploratory analysis of the poems assigned to the anagrammatics of João Guimarães Rosa, in Ave, Palavra, from 1970. For this, approaches of Corpus Linguistics and NLP were used together, associated with the works of rossi_as_2007,brito_aspectos_2012,vital_uma_2021, about the rosian oeuvre. Using computational processing, we extracted the following data from the corpus: a) the number of words; b) type-token ratio; c) the number of stanzas; d) the most frequent words for each anagrammatics. The data were put in form of graphics and wordclouds. From the results, we observed that there are quantitative and qualitative diferences for each poet, reinforcing, through observations of the epigraphs of each author, the complexity evolved on metapoeticity of the anagrammatic’s masks.
