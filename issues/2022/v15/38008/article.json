This online survey aimed to investigate what digital tools are most used by English learners and teachers in Brazil. The investigation was carried out in 2018 and 2019, before the Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and the participants were teachers and students from all regions of Brazil. The participants completed a questionnaire announced in social networks and scientific events in the area of Arts.
