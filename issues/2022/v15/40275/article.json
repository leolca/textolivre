{"title":"Technology-enhanced mathematics learning in Europe: a literature review","language":"spanish","abstract":"The integration of technology in educational processes is a reality in different international education systems, being included in a transversal or specific way in the learning of the different subjects in different educational stages. This paper deals  specifically addresses the way in which technology is used as a methodological tool in the teaching and learning of Mathematics at the Secondary Education in high school. Taking the European Union as a geographical context, a systematic review of the scientific literature hosted in the Web of Science database over the last five years is carried out. The results show that the scientific production is prolific, especially in the last two years and in the Spanish context; that the technological tools used are diverse; and that, regardless of these issues, they are considered to have a positive impact on the educational processes of Mathematics, for both students and teachers.
