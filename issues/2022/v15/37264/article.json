{"title":"Design model of an instrument for learning and adaptive assessment of algebraic knowledge","language":"spanish","abstract":"The objective of this study was to develop a test from the adaptive learning approach, which facilitates a diagnosis that leads to a personalized trajectory of learning activities for university students according to the level of mastery of the competencies for the subject of algebra. Three teachers participated in the design and it was applied to 46 university students. The test scored with an internal consistency of 0.85. The application made it  possible to design the personalized trajectories with which the students were to start and progress in their performance. The results indicate that personalized trajectories constitute an essential support in the application of adaptive learning when working in competency-based models.
