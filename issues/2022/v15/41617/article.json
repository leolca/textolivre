{"title":"Neurodidactic factors in ICT-based teaching: contributions to teacher education","language":"spanish","abstract":"Shifting from a teaching-centred to a learning-centred paradigm implies improving initial teacher training so that the neurodidactic factors of school transformation are optimised and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are properly integrated into educational spaces. Considering the difficulties faced by teachers in the strictly didactic use of ICT, this document refers to the contributions of neurodidactics and the demands of ICT for the updating of initial teacher training. Broadly speaking, it argues for the incorporation of neuroscience content in teacher education curricula to lead to efficient didactic interventions that promote meaningful learning, as well as brain and psychodynamic development. On the other hand, teacher training is advocated on the basis of models that guide the effective integration of ICT in the classroom, such as the TPACK model, the SAMR model, the revised BLOOM model or the Maslow-Gerstein model, which leads to consider the neurodidactic factors that concern virtual teaching and its impact on persistence, success and academic achievement.
