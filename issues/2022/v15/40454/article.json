{"title":"Neuromethodology and neuroimaging for a teacher training","language":"english","abstract":"Neuromethodology is a concept about which we hardly find information in scientific databases and specialized literature. Therefore, the general objective of the study presented is to analyze the relationship between teaching methodology, teaching neuromethodology, educational inclusion, technology and teacher training. The research design is non-experimental, descriptive, explanatory, correlational and regression. The sample used was, by convenience, taken from university teachers from Spanish, Brazilian, Colombian and Paraguayan universities, with a number of 815 participants. The research instrument was an ad hoc Likert scale questionnaire with excellent reliability (Cronbach's Alpha, .969), which was validated in content and construct through an exploratory factor analysis. Correlation analysis and automatic linear modeling provide a first conclusion showing that neuromethodology gives scientificity to the technologies used by the teacher, being fundamental for educational inclusion. The neuroimaging examples provide an idea of the research we are developing in neuromethodology.
