\section{Theoretical background}\label{sec-theoreticalbakcground}

The use of automation in the production of journalistic articles
confronts journalism with threats, opportunities, and ambiguities.
Research has been found indicating that news articles written by humans
differ from news articles written through automation processes. News
written using algorithms shares some similarities with news written by
humans, such as the focus on current events or the use of the inverted
pyramid. But there are also differences in terms of news value; Articles
written by humans tend to exhibit more negativity and impact than
articles written by algorithms. News articles written by humans are more
likely to include interpretation, while articles written by algorithms
tend to be shorter and do not use human sources \cite{tandoc2022noticias}.

Studies have also been found that review the practice of automated
journalism and identify an important limitation on the potential of
automating journalistic writing, such as the absence of sufficient data
models to encode the journalistic knowledge necessary to automatically
write narratives based on events \cite{caswell2018automated}.

On the other hand, in the interview with Eric Aislan Antonelo \cite{rocha2019inteligencia} he warns of the existence of AI, as an emulation of the
intelligence of human beings with applications such as automatic
translation, voice recognition and question and answer systems.

Likewise, articles have also been found based on the discourse of the
information values of the elites and the personalization in the source
of information \cite{manoso2020news} and journalism studies inspired by
Bourdieu that try to explain how journalists make sense of the change
related to technology in the journalistic field \cite{lindblom2022digitalizing}. This seems to link with the idea of the precariousness
to which journalists have been subjected, the main consequence of which
has been to turn their profession into a mere transmitter of messages
instead of being a builder of news with the proper framing work.
