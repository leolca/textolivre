ABSTRACT = {In this new era, it is no longer impossible to create a smart home environment around the household. Moreover, users are not limited to humans but also include pets such as dogs. Dogs need long-term close companionship with their owners; however, owners may occasionally need to be away from home for extended periods of time and can only monitor their dogs&rsquo; behaviors through home security cameras. Some dogs are sensitive and may develop separation anxiety, which can lead to disruptive behavior. Therefore, a novel smart home solution with an affective recommendation module is proposed by developing: (1) an application to predict the behavior of dogs and, (2) a communication platform using smartphones to connect with dog friends from different households. To predict the dogs&rsquo; behaviors, the dog emotion recognition and dog barking recognition methods are performed. The ResNet model and the sequential model are implemented to recognize dog emotions and dog barks. The weighted average is proposed to combine the prediction value of dog emotion and dog bark to improve the prediction output. Subsequently, the prediction output is forwarded to a recommendation module to respond to the dogs&rsquo; conditions. On the other hand, the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server is implemented as a platform to contact a dog&rsquo;s friends on a list to interact with each other. Various tests were carried out and the proposed weighted average led to an improvement in the prediction accuracy. Additionally, the proposed communication platform using basic smartphones has successfully established the connection between dog friends.},

abstract = {This paper discussed the most commonly used similarity measures in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system. In addition, the author introduced some recommendations related to CF system quality improvement which should be considered in the process of formulating similarity measure that may lead to alleviating the issue of data sparsity and some existing measures shortcomings. Generally, CF approach is one of the most widely used and most successful methods for the recommendation system, such as e-commerce. CF system introduced items to the user based on his/her previous ratings and the ratings of his/her neighbors. Therefore, the most important stage in CF system is locating the successful neighbor. Nevertheless, the sparsity of data is the major issue faced by the memory-based CF. The reason behind this is that many of the users rated a few number of items from the huge number of available items. This has encouraged many researchers to provide solutions. One of these solutions was by proposing or updating similarities measures take in considerations the global information preference, all ratings provided by users, the size of common ratings, and so on. In this work, the researcher discussed these measures alongside with their limitations. In addition, the researcher also listed some advices that are important in the process of locating successful neighbors, which may help researchers to improve the quality of CF system.},

The emergence of the most efficient techniques in statistical or bioinformatics situations has therefore become a routine practice in research and industrial sectors. Under practical conditions, dealing with large datasets, it's likely to have inconsistencies and anomalies of all kinds to prevent to know real outcomes for practical problems. For accurate data mining computer based techniques of data pre-processing offer solutions that help the data under processing to conform normal structures which in turn considerably improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. In this process, accurate determination of outliers, extreme values and filling up gaps poses formidable challenges. Multiple methodologies have therefore been developed to detect these deviated or inconsistent values called outliers. Different data pre-processing techniques discussed in this paper could offer most suitable solutions for handling missing values and outliers in all kinds of large datasets such as electric load and weather datasets.},

abstract = {With the growing volume of online information, recommender systems have been an effective strategy to overcome information overload. The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given their widespread adoption in many web applications, along with their potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also to the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. The field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning-based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning-based recommendation models, along with a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. Finally, we expand on current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to this new and exciting development of the field.},
