ABSTRACT: This research questions whether English language teaching courses offered
by Brazilian public universities equip the next generation of teachers with the necessary
skills to teach via distance learning through online environments. The methodology used is
quantitative in nature and considers 118 universities that offer English Language and
Literature courses. Their curricula were analyzed solely to investigate if the courses
offered any modules related to distance learning. Only four institutions propose entire
modules that deal with distance education although they are elective. In order to propose
an alternative to this issue, a suite of three modules related to technology, distance
teaching and learning are presented. TPACK model was used as a guide to analyze the
proposed modules. The development of the modules could establish a more solid and
holistic pre-service teacher education, so that pre-service teachers can be prepared to
teach in online and blended environments.

RESUMO: Esta pesquisa questiona se os cursos de ensino de inglês oferecidos por
Universidades Públicas Brasileiras equipam a próxima geração de professores com as
habilidades necessárias para ensinar via educação a distância através de ambientes
online. A metodologia utilizada é de natureza quantitativa e considera 118 universidades
que oferecem graduação em Língua e Literatura Inglesa. Os respectivos currículos foram
analisados unicamente para investigar se os cursos ofereciam módulos relacionados ao
ensino a distância. Apenas quatro instituições propõem módulos inteiros que lidam com
educação a distância, embora sejam eletivos. Para propor uma alternativa a essa
questão, é apresentado um conjunto de três módulos relacionados à tecnologia, ensino a
distância e aprendizado. O modelo TPACK foi utilizado como um guia para analisar os
módulos propostos. O desenvolvimento dos módulos pode estabelecer uma formação de
professores pré-serviço mais sólida e holística, para que os professores possam estar
preparados para ensinar em ambientes online e híbridos.

to teach distance learning through on-line environments.
English is the second most spoken language among natives and non-natives
around the world (ETHNOLOGUE, 2017). It has been taught in Brazilian schools since
Imperial years and has become a mandatory subject in recent years, taught at secondary
schools (LAW 13.415, 2017). Brazil is the largest country in South America and according
to population estimates presented by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, its
population has exceeded two hundred and eight million people in February 2018 (IBGE 1,
2018). Nevertheless, according to 2017 Education First (EF) English Proficiency Index
(EPI), Brazil is classified with a low proficiency level of English in the forty-first ranked
position out of eighty investigated.
With such a vast population and territory, education plans to strengthen the English
language learning could be implemented to improve Brazilians language proficiency. One
option is to expand English learning distance courses. In order to do so, teacher education
programs could offer specific training for on-line teaching and learning.
It is desirable that teachers understand the differences between teaching face-toface and on-line, and that they develop specific skills to be able to combine knowledge of
content, technology and pedagogy to design and/or manage on-line environments.
The methodology used to answer the key question of this article is quantitative in
nature. It begins with an analysis of 118 public universities in Brazil that are listed in the
2018 Folha University Ranking (RUF) as offering degrees described as “Letras” 2 courses.
Their curriculum was analyzed in order to investigate if the courses offered any modules
related to distance learning.
The next section of this article will discuss distance education and pre-service
training. In addition, data that contextualize the situation of Brazilian Universities regarding
teacher training in distance education will be discussed. After that, a suite of modules will
be presented to propose an alternative to the issue found.

2 Distance Education and Pre-Service Training
Digital Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are present in the daily
lives of a large part of the world population, especially in educational projects
(ARCHAMBAULT; CRIPPEN, 2009). As part of this backdrop, research has shown that
distance education, either exclusively on-line or delivered through blended learning, is part
of secondary education (BORUP; GRAHAM; DRYSDALE, 2014; MIRON; GULOSINO;
SHANK; DAVIDSON, 2017; MOORE-ADAMS; JONES; COHEN, 2016), tertiary education
(ARINTO, 2013; DORNER; KUMAR, 2016; IGNOU, 2017; TURCSÁNYI-SZABÓ, 2012)
and postgraduate degrees (HOFER; GRANDGENETT, 2012; KENNEDY, 2015).
Distance Education (DE) is increasing rapidly (RIENTIES; BROUWER; LYGOBAKER, 2013). Many have argued (CHARBONNEAU-GOWDY; SALINAS; PIZARRO,
2016; KEENGWE; KANG, 2013) that to make education accompany the constant
technological innovation of the 21st century, it is important that pre-service training be
established in teacher education institutions.

Offir (2010) attests that when technologies are implemented in schools, the focus
should be on the teacher, whose role is to connect the pedagogical objectives of the
classroom with the use of technologies. However, a lack of specific training to teach in online environments often leaves teachers to apply prior face-to-face class knowledge in
distance learning contexts (BARAN; CORREIA; THOMPSON, 2011). Researchers report
that educators typically begin their experience with on-line education without previous
training and thus, most of the time, they learn on the basis of trial and error during the
development of their careers (ARCHAMBAULT; CRIPPEN, 2009; HAWKINS; GRAHAM;
BARBOUR, 2012).
Online instruction has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face education
(HAWKINS; GRAHAM; BARBOUR, 2012). However, teaching on-line courses requires the
acquisition of roles, responsibilities and teaching strategies, many of which are different
from those required in face-to-face teaching (HAWKINS; GRAHAM; BARBOUR, 2012).
The on-line and face-to-face classroom environments differ from one another, and each
demands the development of its own pedagogies in order to build effective and meaningful
learning spaces (BARAN; CORREIA; THOMPSON, 2011). Wengrowicz (2014) attests that
to achieve pedagogical goals, teachers make different decisions according to the
environment in which they teach, whether it is face-to-face or on-line instruction.
Innovation must be constant in public education aiming to establish a generation
that can acquire the requirements of the job market of the future (DÍAZ; HORIGUERA,
2016, TURCSÁNYI-SZABÓ, 2012). It is understood that with the advancement of the
internet and Digital ICTs, and with the increasing possibility of the language teacher
entering the DE work environment, it is essential that concepts related to the area be
addressed in their pre-service training. Archambault and Crippen (2009), when describing
the reality of virtual schools in the United States, attest that with the increasing demand of
teachers to work in on-line education, educators will be recruited directly from
undergraduate programs.
In Brazil, the 9057 Decree (2018), updated the legislation that regulates DE and
increased the possibility of offering this modality for secondary and higher education. The
inclusion of aspects related to DE in pre-service teacher courses can mean the
development of better prepared professionals when facing the job market.
Therefore, preparing teachers to teach on-line and expanding English on-line
courses, could provide Brazilians, especially the ones who live in remote areas, with the
opportunity to improve their language proficiency and to be able to interact more actively
with the world.

3 Context of online teacher training in public Brazilian universities
To investigate the curricula of public Brazilian universities that offer English
Language and Literature Courses or Portuguese-English Language and Literature
Courses3, the 2018 RUF was used to obtain an exhaustive list of pertinent universities in
3

In Brazil one can choose to undergo two different branches of the Language and Literature Courses.
“Licenciatura” includes a practice component and students are ready to teach when they finish it. In
“Bacharelado” the student will graduate as a bachelor. If one wishes to be a teacher, they would need to

Brazil. The respective rankings of the universities were not taken into account for the
purposes of this research.
RUF was compared with two other rankings, the 2018 QS World University Ranking
and the 2017 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Ranking. The objective was
to increase the scope of the analyses to include the majority of language and literature
courses offered by public Brazilian universities.
To achieve the 2018 RUF list of universities, the website was accessed, and a
search was made choosing pre-established fields that included: courses, state, city and
administrative nature. For course, the closest option was Language and Literature. All
states and cities where included in the search and the choice for administrative nature was
the public option.
The first result included 133 establishments. Some institutions were considered only
once in the ranking but are constituted of more than one campus and sometimes present
different curricula, so the different campuses were added to the list. Nonetheless,
universities that offered only bachelor’s degree courses, the ones that did not offer English
courses and distance courses were disregarded. The final list of institutions from RUF was
compared to QS World University Ranking and THE World University Ranking. All public
universities listed in the two rankings are part of the ones listed in RUF. The final number
of universities investigated was 118.
The universities websites were searched and the Pedagogical Project and/or the
curricular matrix of the courses were collected. The missing information was obtained by
emailing the course organizers. Considering the documents gathered, syllabus modules
related to teaching and technology and, more specifically, distance learning and teaching
were analyzed to determine which institutions offer modules that deal with on-line learning
and teaching.
Considering the 118 universities investigated,48 offer modules related to
technology, half of them compulsory. Three institutions offer elective modules that include
discussions about distance learning and three others offer compulsory ones. These
modules have a workload that vary between 45 to 60 hours. Discussions include, among
other topics, digital literacies, digital genres, teacher and student’s roles in computer
mediated learning environments, teaching English on-line, teacher training and distance
education. Nevertheless, since the modules do not exclusively deal with distance
education, the amount of time dedicated to work with these topics can be relatively small
considering that their overall objectives are to discuss teaching English and technology, in
general.
Only four universities propose entire modules that deal with distance education.
They have a workload from 30 to 45 hours and are all electives. They deal with
fundamentals of distance education, legislation related to the topic, main theories and
approaches to distance learning, planning, designing and managing courses, materials
and evaluation, challenges related to student´s evasion and teacher and tutor training.
Even though they cover some important aspects they are electives and there is no
guarantee that students will choose to take them during their studies.
Considering the data presented, it is understood that distance education is a
peripheral subject in teacher education in public Brazilian universities. Pre-service courses
complement their education. This research focus on “licenciatura” courses.

do not appear to prepare teachers to teach on-line. Nonetheless, it is of the utmost
importance that student-teachers discuss the specificities of teaching and learning in online environments.
In order to do so, this article proposes a suite of three modules that will be
incorporated into the curriculum reformulation of a Brazilian federal university in the southeastern region of the country. As an addition to the proposal, the modules were analyzed
considering the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge model (TPACK). The next
section will bring considerations about TPACK, following the modules proposal and their
respective analyses.
4 What is TPACK?
For Mishra and Koehler (2006) technology cannot be understood as an isolated
component when considering areas of knowledge for the development of quality
education. Rather, it should be connected and integrated with the content and pedagogical
components of the knowledge being worked on. The authors defend the relationship and
articulation of this knowledge as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: TPACK model.

The TPACK model, extended from the idea of Shulman's Pedagogical Content
Knowledge (1986), “attempts to identify the nature of the knowledge required by teachers
for technological integration in their teaching, addressing the complex, multifaceted and
situated nature of teacher knowledge” (KOEHLER, 2017, p.1).
The seven bases of knowledge, according to Koehler (2012), Koehler and Mishra
(2009), Koehler, Mishra and Cain (2013) and Mishra and Koehler (2006) are: Content
knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK); Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK),
Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Technological
Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK).
The authors explain that CK is the knowledge of the subject to be taught and
30

learned. PK is the teacher’s knowledge of teaching, learning practices, approaches and
methods. PCK is related to specific pedagogical knowledge. It encompasses teaching,
learning, curriculum, evaluation and the interconnection of these elements. It also
incorporates class planning, management and evaluation. TK is the knowledge about
working with technologies, their tools and resources. It goes beyond basic computing, and
entails being able to productively apply technology in daily life. TCK is the way the subject
being taught can be changed by technology.
When it comes to TPK, it is the knowledge of how technologies can be used in
teaching and learning and what different results can be reached with them. In addition, it is
the ability to choose the most appropriate tool and strategy to reach learning objectives;
not to mention in-depth knowledge of technology resources and constraints.
TPACK goes beyond the combination of the four components (pedagogy, content
and technology),
TPACK is the basis of effective teaching with technology, requiring an
understanding of the representation of concepts using technologies; pedagogical
techniques that use technologies in constructive ways to teach content; knowledge
of what makes concepts difficult or easy to learn and how technology can help
redress some of the problems that students face; knowledge of students’ prior
knowledge and theories of epistemology; and knowledge of how technologies can
be used to build on existing knowledge to develop new epistemologies or
strengthen old ones (KOEHLER; MISHRA, 2009, p. 66).

The authors argue that for technology to be successfully integrated into teaching,
both in practice and in theory, interaction must occur between content, pedagogy and
technology. Teachers should not only develop fluency to work with each of the three
elements but above all they must know how to interconnect them to promote effective
learning outcomes (KOEHLER; MISHRA, 2009).
Despite its widespread acceptance, criticisms have also been directed towards the
TPACK model. Brantley-Dias and Ertmer (2013) state that the model is very large and
vague, and even though several researchers have used it, there is still no simple and
precise definition of its components and constructs. Reyes, Reading, Doyle and Gregory
(2017, p. 2) comment on other issues:
Graham argues that TPACK suffers from ‘conceptual complexity’ (2011, p.
1955). Gess-Newsome contends that the theoretical moorings of TPACK
are questionable since it is built on Shulman's PCK which has been
described as plagued with a ‘substantial degree of overlapping of ideas’
highlighting ‘the fuzzy borders between knowledge domains’ (GessNewsome, 2002, p. 6). Perhaps, one of the most serious criticisms has
been what Angeli and Valdines claim about how ‘the framework does not
make explicit the connections among content, pedagogy and technology’
(2009, p. 157) in relation to the theorisation of TPACK’ ( REYES; READING;
DOYLE; GREGORY, 2017, p. 2).

Nevertheless, several studies advocate the use of TPACK for preparing teachers to
deliver on-line teaching. Herring, Koehler and Mishra (2016) defend that the TPACK
31

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre

DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.11.3.26-39

should be used according to specific teaching and learning contexts, considering the
complex integration of the three knowledge fields. Therefore, the TPACK model is
considered appropriate for the purposes of this research and will serve as support to the
development of a suite of modules for on-line teaching.
Additionally, the research of Moore-Adams, Jones and Cohen (2016), presents a
detailed table of types of knowledge and skills by TPACK knowledge domain. These
domains that should be dealt with in teacher education will also be used to complement
the critical analyses of the modules.

5 Suite of Modules for Pre-service language teacher training for distance education
In 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Education and the National Council of Education
defined the National Curricular Guidelines for teachers’ initial training in undergraduate
courses throughout Brazil (Resolution CNE/CP n.2, 2017). As a result, the curriculum of a
Language and Literature Course in a Brazilian Federal University was reformulated.
Discussions about the curriculum reformulation began in 2016, during meetings
held by the institute of English Language and Literature undergraduate course. Work
groups were defined among the teachers who were in charge of structuring modules that
would be part of the topics of specific training, pedagogical, academic-scientific-cultural
and elective components of the course.
One of the elements that guided the entire project was to consider the profession
that the students would consider upon completion of the course. It was determined that the
new curriculum would seek to empower students to work in secondary and tertiary
education. Moreover, they would be able to work for language schools or become private
language teachers. These professionals should be able to deal with technologies in other
to build a school in harmony with the advancements of the twenty first century
(GUILHERME et al., 2017).
In order to create an environment where digital literacy can be developed, one
group was responsible for suggesting and building modules related to digital
communication technologies and information technology in teaching and learning
languages.
The initial premise suggested by this specific group was that technology should be
integrated throughout all subjects of the course so that students would familiarize
themselves with it during the entire course. Additionally, three compulsory modules where
incorporated into the curriculum: “English language teaching and digital technologies”,
“Teaching English on-line: theoretical-methodological approaches” and “Placement”. A
description of each module and its analyses will be presented.
5.1

English language teaching and digital technologies

This module was articulated so that the undergraduate student could have a first
contact with the use of digital ICTs in teaching and learning face-to-face. It has a workload
of 75 hours and will be taught during the fifth term of the undergraduate course. It has, as
its main objectives, to discuss digital technologies for teaching and learning English as a
32

Belo Horizonte, v. 11, n. 3, p. 26-39, set.-dez. 2018 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.11.3.26-39

foreign language; to reflect critically on global aspects of the English language in digital
technology-mediated social life; and to analyze digital technologies that can be used in
teaching and learning English in the contemporary world.
Some of the topics to be discussed include the theoretical aspects of teaching
English with digital technologies, multi-modality, digital tools, pedagogical mediation, task
design, global and local English and digital technologies for enhancing respect for
language in its social functioning and the difference between cultures.
Addressing these elements students will be practicing varied aspects of TPACK. For
instance, TK by using and choosing technology, its tools and resources to deliver content;
CK by discussing and building knowledge on theoretical aspects; PK and PCK by working
on pedagogical mediation; TCK and TPK by designing tasks “[…] that are collaborative,
highly interactive, and motivating, while encouraging engagement with the content”
(MOORE-ADAMS; JONES; COHEN, 2016, p. 340).
It is important to highlight again one of the keys concepts of TPACK, that content,
pedagogy and technology must be integrated. So, different elements are being dealt
concomitantly and repeatedly throughout the course in different modules, discussions and
tasks.
After concluding this module, it is expected that students will have had the
opportunity to discuss the impact of technology on teaching and learning and how to use
such theories and tools in their pedagogical practice.
5.2

Teaching English on-line: theoretical-methodological approaches

This second module is designed as blended learning so that students can
experience learning in an on-line environment as part of their instruction. According to Wolf
(2006, p. 57), “By forcing the teacher to take the role of student, the teacher finally learns
to understand students' fears, stress, frustrations and joys in learning in the Web-based
environment".
The module has a workload of 75 hours and it is planned to take place in the sixth
term of the course. Its general objective is to reflect, experience, and critically discuss
proposals related to the distance teaching and learning of English, and their particularities.
Its specific objectives include knowing distance education history and its legislations,
discussing skills and abilities of teachers and students needed on the virtual learning
environment, exploring aspects related to pedagogical mediation, feedback and course
design.
Subjects as teaching and learning experiences, critical-reflexive education for
language teachers in virtual environments, roles of teacher, tutors and apprentices in online courses, on-line assignments, on-line teaching environments and massive open online courses (MOOCs) are also part of the syllabus.
This module is essential when teacher pre-service education is considered because
it deals with the idiosyncrasies of virtual modality, as they differ from face-to-face
approaches. In the planning stage learners should understand the distance learning
context by studying its history, public policies and how it can be used as an inclusive tool.
Moreover, focus is needed towards teaching-learning experiences in virtual modality
and critical-reflexive teaching, so educators can continuously analyze and critique their
33

http://periodicos.letras.ufmg.br/index.php/textolivre
Belo Horizonte, v. 11, n. 3, p. 26-39, set.-dez. 2018 – ISSN 1983-3652
DOI: 10.17851/1983-3652.11.3.26-39

pedagogical practice throughout their careers. By addressing the role of teachers, tutors
and learners, as well as issues related to interaction, feedback and virtual mediation, the
specificities of distance teaching and learning are dealt with. Calling the attention to how
important these elements are, allows teachers to build and deliver a meaningful and
quality environment to learners.
Other topics relate to course design, learning platforms, assignments and didactic
material. Furthermore, learners will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge built
during the semester by designing a course plan and lessons, making decisions about
assignments, didactic material, tools, feedback and mediation. This way, students will be
able to experiment on-line teaching and learning platforms, such as Moodle Cloud.
Concerning TPACK, different elements are present throughout the course such as
getting in contact with on-line environments (TK), building knowledge on content and
technology (CK), providing “online leadership in a manner that promotes student success
through regular feedback, prompt, response and clear expectations” (MOORE-ADAMS;
JONES; COHEN, 2016, p. 339) (PK), building knowledge integrating technologies (TCK),
discussing “knowledge of language learning theories for online language learning”
(MOORE-ADAMS; JONES; COHEN, 2016, p. 340) (TPK) and the monitoring of students
interactions (TPACK).
It is intended that by the end of the second module, students will be exposed to online environments where they will have a great deal of opportunities to build knowledge on
theories of on-line teaching practice. To introduce a more practical approach to their
education, a third module called “Placement” was proposed.
5.3

Placement

During this module, students are expected to design and teach virtual or blended
workshops or English courses for the local community using the Moodle platform. It is
comprised largely of pedagogical practice for distance education. Teacher-learners will
have the opportunity to create real courses and understand, exchange and build
knowledge through their own experiences.
The module has a workload of 105 hours and its syllabus consists of planning
courses for distance and blended learning, class planning, didactic material preparation for
virtual learning environments, on-line English teaching and diversity, distance learning,
assessment and reflective practice. They will spend most of the time planning, designing
and teaching the course.
Adding up the knowledge built in the two previous modules, students will be able to
deal with TK skills by using technology, different software, creation of curriculum design
and evaluation. Considering CK they will “continually extend their content and
technological knowledge” (MOORE-ADAMS; JONES; COHEN, 2016, p. 338). They will
have opportunities to develop PK skills and knowledge like monitoring “student interaction
and communication, balance structure and flexibility, establish presence on the course to
motivate students, model and participate in students discussion” (MOORE-ADAMS;
JONES; COHEN, 2016, p. 339) and much more. They can also provide different
opportunities for learning using different media (TCK and TPK), monitor students
interaction and learning, promote opportunities for communication, interaction, cultural
34

exchange, on-line learning and be part of a community of practice (PCK and TPACK).
Nonetheless, elements of TPACK are supposed to have been dealt with in previous
moments during the undergraduate course. For instance, CK would be dealt with in
modules that focus on English language learning, PK in pedagogical modules and TK in all
subjects during the course.
With the implementation of the new curriculum and the suite of modules described
above, students should have sufficient theory and practice to develop meaningful work in
on-line environments. Furthermore, as in-service teachers, qualified professionals should
“focus on updating their knowledge of new teaching methodologies and approaches”
(KELLY; GRENFELL, 2017, p.14). That applies as well to new technologies on teaching
and learning.

6 Final considerations
The objective of this article was to investigate if English language teaching courses
offered by Brazilian public universities equip the next generation of teachers with the
necessary skills to teach distance learning through on-line environments.
The data presented reveals that the majority of Brazilian public universities curricula
still do not address teacher training for distance education. This fact could be changed so
that pre-service education of language teachers accompanies the educational and
technological transformation of today’s world. According to Comas-Quinn (2011, p. 218)
“The shift goes beyond the acquisition of ICT skills and requires a pedagogical
understanding of the affordances of the new medium and an acceptance by the teacher of
his or her new role and identity.”
In order to achieve this goal, a suite of modules related to technology and distance
learning was presented. The syllabuses of the modules were associated with the TPACK
model to illustrate knowledge and skills that can be built throughout the three terms.
The way teachers, pre-service or in-service, perceive on-line teaching is directly
associated with the approaches and techniques they are going to put into practice and
interferes in the “student learning processes and outcomes” (BADIA; GARCIA; JULIO,
2017, p. 1193). The development of the modules could establish a more solid and holistic
pre-service teacher education, so that students can be prepared to teach in on-line and
blended environments.
The education system has to accompany the technology revolution that has been
established during recent years and teacher education must take it into consideration how
to prepare teachers for work in different fields.
It is not the intention of this article to provide a descriptive model to be reproduced
in other contexts. Its aims are to portray the reality of a specific university. However, this
research is expected to contribute to discussions that could result in considerable changes
to pre-service teacher education considering local and global contexts.
It is understood that on the process of data collection, all information was gathered
on-line and/or requested via email or telephone contact, but not all institutions replied to it.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the data collected was up to date or complete on
the universities’ websites.

To complement this research, a longitudinal investigation could be done to analyse
students’ knowledge and skills at the end of each college term. This research can be
conducted from the moment the new curriculum is implemented using TPACK surveys and
